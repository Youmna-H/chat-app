 Discussion Title: Brexit will have a positive effect on the political life of the European Union

1. Brexit will have a positive effect on the political life of the European Union. See also excellent page [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_Brexit_on_the_European_Union) .
1.1. Pro: The expressed opinions in EU have shrunk and agreements over domestic policy and budget priorities will be easier to reach.
1.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that the withdrawl of one member state will have a significant impact on the ability to come to agreement.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Since Brexit, there are still [27 member states in the European Union.](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en)
1.1.2. Pro: The exit of UK and its strongly Atlantic agenda gives a historical opportunity for EU to sort out its check and balances, between the hard-economic bloc \(i.e. Northern EU\), the social-and-debt bloc \(i.e. Southern EU\), and the Eastern bloc which has an occasion to stop its escape out of democracy.
1.1.3. Pro: The absence of the UK moves the EU centre of gravity one tick to the east, and offers an opportunity to have tough but constructive discussions with Russia.
1.2. Con: Brexit will change the institutional makeup of the European Union.
1.2.1. Pro: [27 of the 73 seats formerly held by British MEP's will be redistributed to member states](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/06/05/the-european-parliament-after-brexit-what-would-it-look-like/), thus providing some countries with a stronger presence.
1.2.2. Con: In the long term, the number of representatives will not decrease.[Out of the UK's seats, 46 of the 73 will be reserved for future expansion](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/06/05/the-european-parliament-after-brexit-what-would-it-look-like/) while the remaining will be redistributed to existing members.
1.3. Pro: The Brexit process is clouded by uncertainty. The European Union can leverage this [uncertainty](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2019/november-2019/in-focus-uncertainty-and-brexit​) to present the institution as one which provides member countries with stability and continuity.
1.4. Pro: EU institutions have an incentive to be more aware and responsive to the requests of citizens in individual countries by reflecting on how this did not happen with UK.
1.4.1. Pro: Learning from past mistakes will help avoid falling into similar traps in the future.
1.4.2. Con: If member countries have a number of diverging interests, EU institutions may be unable to accomodate them.
1.4.3. Pro: The grievances expressed by those who supported Britain's withdrawl from the European Union can be used as a foundation for instigating internal reform within the European Union.
1.4.4. Con: The incentive to be aware and responsive will be reduced if EU institutions collectively think that Brexit is mostly an internal UK problem that has nothing to do with the EU.
1.4.5. Con: One of the major concerns expressed by the leave campaign in the UK was the need to [take back sovereignty](https://www.ft.com/content/e0b30912-1fff-11e9-a46f-08f9738d6b2b). It would be difficult for the EU to accomodate this as it would undermine their power, authority and their ability to carry out core functions.
1.4.6. Con: EU institutions may have incentive to instead take a hard line against member countries who go against institutional norms.
1.5. Con: Following Brexit, other member countries may be inclined to leave the EU.
1.5.1. Con: One study measures the [exit propensities of other countries and concludes that it is unlikely](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/12/11/will-another-country-follow-the-uk-out-of-the-eu-this-is-why-its-unlikely/) that another member country will be inclined to leave the EU following Brexit.
1.5.2. Pro: If a sufficient number of countries, leave this will undermine the existing benefits such as freedom of movement and free trade.
1.5.3. Pro: Brexit has demonstrated that leaving is a realistic option for other countries.
1.5.3.1. Con: As of early 2020, Brexit has only demonstrated that it is legally possible to withdraw from the EU. To demonstrate that it is a 'realistic option', there must be post-Brexit prosperity in Britain.
1.5.4. Con: The argument that Britain leaving the EU will result in other countries leaving the EU is a [slippery slope fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope).
1.6. Pro: Many negative results reached by GB as a country will be viewed as a loss of a potential that would have been available inside the EU
1.6.1. Pro: If post-Brexit Britain suffers socio-economically, the EU can portray itself as the provider of prosperity.
1.6.2. Pro: Any post-Brexit misfortunes experienced by Britain may strengthen the relationship between the European Union and member states.
1.6.2.1. Pro: If post-Brexit Britain struggles then the European Union can cite Britain as an example of the negative consequences of leaving the European Union. This will strengthen the perception of member states that they benefit from their relationship with the European Union.
1.7. Con: Many positive results reached by GB as a country will be viewed as a potential that could not be expressed inside the EU, sustaining the idea that political life in the EU is repressing the potential of individual countries.
1.7.1. Pro: If the UK are able to negotiate trade agreements with the world, many may view this as a consequence of stronger national sovereignty and economic freedom, only made possible by leaving the EU.
1.7.1.1. Con: Given that the UK and EU were not able to come to a compromise for Brexit, the likelihood that that would occur is next to nothing
1.7.2. Con: Britain will not prosper from their decision to leave the European Union.
1.7.2.1. Con: [Britain can prosper](https://www.ft.com/content/05e5fcf0-176a-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385) post-Brexit if they continue to attract the best global talent.
1.7.2.2. Con: Britain has the conditions to be an economic powerhouse even without the benefits afforded by the European Union.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: The UK [have three universities which are in the top 10](https://capx.co/forget-being-big-or-small-and-embrace-freedom/) global higher education institutions.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: Conditions are nothing without bipartisanship, which based on three years of infighting does not seem very likely to occur.
1.8. Con: Brexit will [undermine the 'liberal' ideological bloc in the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_Brexit_on_the_European_Union#Ideological_shift).
1.8.1. Pro: The loss of a liberal member state will [lead to more protectionist trade policies.](https://www.votewatch.eu/blog/the-policy-implications-of-the-proposed-post-brexit-seats-redistribution-in-the-european-parliament/)
1.8.2. Con: The removal of the UK from the EU [does not mean](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2020/01/22/next-brexit-phase-represents-an-opportunity-to-make-eu-trade-policy-more-open/) that the interests formerly championed by the UK within the EU, will disappear entirely.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Other public or private actors that align with the UK on trade policy [will move to secure their interests in a post-Brexit world](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2020/01/22/next-brexit-phase-represents-an-opportunity-to-make-eu-trade-policy-more-open/).
1.8.3. Pro: The [more statist and protectionist bloc within the EU will strengthen](https://www.ft.com/content/235ff2da-3bbe-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a).
1.9. Con: As a consequence of Brexit, The European Union will be weaker in the field of defence and foreign affairs.
1.9.1. Con: A deal between the European Union and the United Kingdom [will likely involve cooperation on defence issues.](https://www.euronews.com/2019/12/04/how-will-brexit-impact-europe-s-defence-euronews-answers)
1.9.1.1. Con: Even if some cooperation is agreed, it is likely that it will be less than when the United Kingdom were part of the EU because defence issues are [likely to be politically sensitive for British citizens](https://www.euronews.com/2019/12/04/how-will-brexit-impact-europe-s-defence-euronews-answers) and considered an issue connected to sovereignty.
1.9.1.2. Con: Brexit withdrawal negotiations show that [EU member states are reluctant to grant the UK the status of privileged partner](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/02/05/post-brexit-eu-shows-little-appetite-for-defense-cooperation/) for fear that other countries outside of the EU \(such as the US\) could ask for the same privileges. This attitude may impede cooperation.
1.9.1.3. Con: The [EU has blocked the UK from accessing military-grade data](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/02/05/post-brexit-eu-shows-little-appetite-for-defense-cooperation/) from the Galileo Global Navigation Satellite System.
1.9.2. Con: The [most important institution of European defence is NATO.](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexit-european-security-and-defence-three-assumptions-three-realities/) Thus, Britain leaving the European Union will not have a significant effect on European defence.
1.9.2.1. Con: [NATO is a military organisation and doesn't deal with non-military security issues](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexit-european-security-and-defence-three-assumptions-three-realities/) such as transnational crime, domestic terrorism, etc.
1.9.3. Con: With one actor less in the decision process, it will be naturally easier to reach an agreement in the EU, so defence and foreign affairs might actually be improved.
1.9.4. Pro: The UK [would no longer be involved in](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/brexit/negotiations/what-would-a-no-deal-brexit-mean-for-uk-and-eu-defence-cooperation/) EU decision making mechanisms used to organise joint responses to foreign policy challenges.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Member states [must agree on a unanimous basis](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/brexit/negotiations/what-would-a-no-deal-brexit-mean-for-uk-and-eu-defence-cooperation/) to the creation of an EU-led military operation.
1.9.5. Con: It is estimated that [90%](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/brexit/negotiations/what-would-a-no-deal-brexit-mean-for-uk-and-eu-defence-cooperation/) of the UK's defence industrial collaboration with other European member states operates outside of the EU, on a bilateral or multilateral basis.
1.9.6. Pro: The UK was arguably the EU's strongest military power.
1.9.6.1. Pro: The UK was one of two member states possessing ['full spectrum' military capabilities](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/uk%E2%80%93eu-defence-and-security-cooperation).
1.9.7. Pro: The UK [contributed military personnel, expertise and military equipment for EU missions](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/uk%E2%80%93eu-defence-and-security-cooperation).
1.9.7.1. Pro: The UK [provided maritime support](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-piracy-off-the-coast-of-somalia/2010-to-2015-government-policy-piracy-off-the-coast-of-somalia) in an EU operation to counter piracy in the coast of Somalia.
1.10. Con: UK was one of the biggest net contributor to the EU budget, so the other countries will have to make up for the loss.
1.10.1. Pro: The UK has been the [third or fourth largest contributing country](https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-one-biggest-contributors-eu-budget/) to the EU budget in recent years.
1.10.2. Pro: The UK is [one of 10 countries to contribute more than it gets back from the EU](https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-one-biggest-contributors-eu-budget/).
1.10.3. Pro: In 2018, after factoring in a £4 billion rebate, the UK paid [£13 billion to the EU budget](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/).
1.10.4. Con: With one less player present in the European Union, the spending cost of the European Union should decrease in accordance.
1.10.5. Pro: Concern over who will makeup the UK's contribution to the budget is resulting in [heated debate between the remaining member countries](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/brexit-europe-countries-may-have-to-pay-more-into-the-eu-budget.html).
1.10.5.1. Pro: According to one European official, the discussion over who pays what "[will shape up to be a long drawn out bloody fight](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/brexit-europe-countries-may-have-to-pay-more-into-the-eu-budget.html)".
1.10.5.2. Con: Heated debate does not mean that member countries will not eventually come to an agreement over budget contributions.
1.10.5.2.1. Pro: Even if countries come to agreement reluctantly, compromise is a reality of politics.
1.10.5.3. Pro: Disagreement may lead to tensions developing between member countries and the European Union as an institution.
