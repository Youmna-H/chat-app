 Discussion Title: Veganism is a natural right

1. [Veganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism) is a [natural right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights_and_legal_rights).
1.1. Con: Veganism is akin to a religious dietary right. For example, a person has a natural right to eat only Kosher food, but does not have a right to force a restaurant to conform with Kosher regulations.
1.1.1. Pro: The Wikipedia article about [natural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights_and_legal_rights) explains that the enforcement of natural rights can be "forfeited through one's actions", specifically "by violating someone else's rights". So, a vegan's right to exercise their veganism is limited because it conflicts with a restaurant's right to be non-vegan.
1.1.1.1. Con: A restaurant can only be non-vegan by disregarding the natural rights of animals. Therefore, a non-vegan restaurant's claim that a vegan's right denies their right to be non-vegan is wrongly balanced insofaras its perceived right to be non-vegan deprives the animal's natural right to life and liberty.
1.1.1.2. Con: A vegan can abstain from eating non-vegan food, and thereby not attempt to violate the restaurant's right to self-determination. It does not mean that the vegan has been denied their right to be vegan, but rather that the vegan is exercising their right.
1.1.2. Con: Veganism is a moral position against doing harm to animals, which is to exercise justice toward the natural rights of animals. Religious dietary restrictions are not necessarily motivated by the respect for rights belonging to others, but primarily as conditions for acceptance in the religion.
1.2. Pro: Natural rights, although not enumerated anywhere, are self-evident freedoms that allow a person to make choices for themselves. People are normally free to choose whichever foods are available to them as nourishment for their body. Veganism is just a name of the philosophy behind how people are choosing to eat. Therefore, it is a natural right.
1.2.1. Pro: The right to food as outlined by the United Nations \(UN\) states that the food should be [culturally acceptable](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet34en.pdf) \(page 3\). Some cultures practise veganism.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Ital cooking - which is vegan - is an important part of [Rastafari](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/food/the-plate/2016/07/for-rastas--eating-from-the-earth-is-a-sacred-duty/) religion and culture.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Veganism is increasingly practised in [Jainism](https://plantshift.com/blog/the-vegan-movement-in-the-jain-community).
1.2.2. Pro: It is generally acknowledged that people are not entitled to food as a means of sustenance, but in fact must seek and procure food for sustenance unless it is otherwise given to them. A vegan is no less entitled to seek and procure food on the grounds that the range of their search is limited with respect to animals.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The United Nations \(UN\) stipulates that the right to food is not the same as a [right to be fed](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet34en.pdf). \(page 3\)
1.2.3. Con: To claim natural rights 'are self-evident' would preclude Veganism as a natural right. The fact this debate exists means it is not a [self evident](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/self-evident) claim.
1.3. Con: Veganism isn't necessary for survival, therefore it is not a right.
1.3.1. Con: Switching to a plant-based diet helps fight [climate change](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49238749), which is an existential threat to our survival.
1.3.2. Pro: According to modern \(social\) contract theory, the right to life is the most central natural right, on the basis of which all other natural rights are deduced.
1.3.2.1. Pro: [Thomas Hobbes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/) states that each person has the natural right to preserve themselves, which he calls the “the right of nature.”
1.3.2.1.1. Con: As long as a vegan diet does not place the eater's life at risk, a non-vegan diet cannot be justified by Hobbes' law.
1.3.2.2. Con: There is a more fundamental right in nature: that of the sovereignty of man. If it weren't for that right, all animals would fight man in order to preserve their own life.
1.3.3. Pro: Food types such as 'vegan' are not necessary for sustenance.
1.3.4. Pro: Natural rights should be kept minimal, so that universal laws could more reasonably be fashioned to protect these rights.
1.3.4.1. Con: Natural rights exist naturally regardless of whether they are recognised.
1.3.5. Con: Most Vegans are vegan for reason of [conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience). Being forced to behave contrary to one's conscience can produce mental health problems \(eg: trauma, cognitive dissonance, guilt, resentment\).
1.3.6. Con: The Right of Conscience is generally accepted as a Natural Right and is usually included in some form wherever there is a Bill of Rights. \(Eg: United Nations: [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html), Article 18\).
1.4. Pro: People can eat whatever they want as long as it does no harm
1.4.1. Con: A person who eats a deadly food will not be able to continue eating, therefore humans do not have a natural right to eat whatever they want.
1.4.2. Pro: As long as [the harm principle](https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-the-harm-principle/) is not violated, humans have a natural right to self-determination. This includes the right to determine their diet.
1.4.2.1. Con: Veganism is not simply an independent expression of self-determination; it impacts and imposes on others and so ultimately limits others' freedom of self-determination too.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Many dinner party hosts likely feel obligated to offer a vegan option for vegan guests, which infringes on their dinner party plans.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if a dinner party host feels obligated to provide a vegan option, this does not mean they are in fact obligated. Rather, the decision is a choice made by the dinner party host.
1.4.2.2. Con: The [Harm Principle](https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-the-harm-principle/) is a political philosophical principal and is not designed to guide the actions of individuals. It is intended to restrict the scope of criminal law and government restrictions of personal liberty. Therefore, the Harm Principle is not to be applied to the personal choice of diet.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Just because a principle or concept is typically applied in a certain domain or context, this does not mean it cannot then be applied in other contexts.
1.4.3. Con: Only a general right to food is recognised in [international law](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet34en.pdf). \(pages 1-3\)
1.5. Con: The idea of framing veganism as a natural right is to characterise service providers failing to offer vegan options as violating rights, not merely a right to procure vegan food without any impositions on others. Positive rights such as that do not exist.
1.6. Con: Veganism is not necessary for survival and humans did not evolve to be vegan naturally. This makes veganism a choice unnecessary for survival. Therefore Veganism is an artificial ideology, not a natural right.
1.7. Pro: [Conscious creatures](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201801/animal-consciousness-new-report-puts-all-doubts-sleep) have Natural Rights corresponding to their potential to need them. Among the greatest of those rights is the right to not be abused or deprived of life. A human is therefore naturally entitled \(and morally obligated\) to make choices to respect animals' natural rights while procuring provisions to sustain their own life \(eg: food, shelter, warmth\).
1.7.1. Pro: An animal cannot be eaten without being harmed.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Animals have the same natural rights as humans.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Justice considers whether an aggrieved individual has a right to be aggrieved. Animals can grieve and suffer, as can humans, therefore animals and humans have the same right to be aggrieved when they are aggrieved in the same way.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Humans do not choose to be humans instead of animals, and animals do not choose to be animals instead of humans. Therefore perfect morality cannot show favour to human rights over animal rights by virtue only of the fact that they are different species.
1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Humans are more valuable than other species, therefore their rights are more important.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Not all rights are equal. For instance, if one person's right infringes another person's right, a judgement must be found as to whose right has more weight. An offence that causes greater grievance is typically considered more weighty than a lesser aggrievance. For example, it would typically be morally right to harm a person's property if doing so would prevent harm to a person's life.
1.7.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Humans are equipped with the highest power of intellect and ability of all species on Earth, being capable of creating an environment wherein the conditions for life are like paradise.
1.7.1.1.3. Pro: Even if they cannot express it in the same ways, [animals can suffer just as much](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/do-animals-feel-pain-in-the-same-way-as-humans-do-10371800.html) as humans.
1.7.1.2. Con: If the animal is already dead when the person comes across it - for instance, as a result of accidental death - then the person does not harm the animal by subsequently eating it.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Some people regularly cook and eat roadkill, including chef Doug Paine who ran a [roadkill supper club](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/15/how-to-eat-roadkill-everything-you-need-to-know) in Vermont.
1.7.1.2.2. Pro: The [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals \(PETA\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals) [supports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/15/how-to-eat-roadkill-everything-you-need-to-know) eating roadkill over meat coming from slaughterhouses.
1.7.2. Pro: In 2020, a UK tribunal ruled that [ethical veganism constitutes a philosophical belief](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50981359). As a result, it is a ["protected characteristics"](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/equality-act/protected-characteristics) against which ethical vegans cannot be discriminated.
1.7.3. Pro: When vegans are not served in prison vegan meals, some would say that it's a form of cruel and unusual punishment.
1.8. Pro: The vegan lifestyle is sufficient to sustain human life. When compared to a non-vegan lifestyle, a vegan lifestyle does less harm to other species and results in a lesser sum of harms against other species. Therefore, veganism is a more basic level of lifestyle for survival than non-veganism, and non-vegans are essentially choosing to augment that basic lifestyle with non-vegan furnishings.
1.9. Pro: Humans sit in the greatest position of control on earth, to rule it and shape it as though the highest power in it. Since we are considering that inalienable rights are endowed by natural law, we must be inferring that there is a natural preference for how justice is shaped. Nature, \(particularly the expression of life\), is most at [peace](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/peace) when ruled in [fairness](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fair), so it follows that natural law should direct humans to be [benevolent](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/benevolent). Humans are meant to be vegan.
1.9.1. Pro: The only way a vegan can be deprived of the opportunity to be vegan, is to include some non-vegan artifact in the product that the vegan is apportioned. Such non-vegan artifacts are derived from species existing on a level in the [food chain](https://www.britannica.com/science/food-chain) that is above the vegetative \(primary\) level. Therefore any component of a product making it unsuitable for vegan consumption is a contamination of the primary level of the food chain, to which a vegan would otherwise naturally have used.
1.9.2. Con: The inference that humans are meant to be vegan because they are well-suited to being so amounts to the [naturalistic fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Naturalistic-Fallacy).
1.9.3. Pro: Humans have short, soft fingernails and small canine teeth. In [contrast](https://www.peta.org/living/food/really-natural-truth-humans-eating-meat/), carnivores all have sharp claws and large canine teeth that are capable of tearing flesh.
1.9.3.1. Pro: [Many vegetarian animals have bigger and sharper canines than humans](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/05/19/478645426/humans-are-meathooked-but-not-designed-for-meat-eating). This indicates that human canines are not specifically designed to process meat.
1.9.4. Con: The concept of justice is an artificial concept, entirely created by man. Therefore there is no natural preference for justice.
1.9.5. Pro: As opposed to carnivorous animals, humans' stomach acids are much [weaker](https://www.veganlifemag.com/human-v-carnivore-issue-10/) in comparison, because strong acids aren’t needed to digest pre-chewed fruits and vegetables.
1.9.6. Con: It is [likely](https://time.com/4252373/meat-eating-veganism-evolution/) that without an appropriate diet containing significant amounts of animal proteins, humans would not have evolved into modern and intelligent beings.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Meat allowed early humans [to consume foods with less chewing](https://time.com/4252373/meat-eating-veganism-evolution/) than if they had consumed root foods, ensuring that meals were more nutrient dense.
1.9.7. Con: Humans were created by the mindless force of evolution, not by a creator with intentions we might discern; thus we are not "meant to be" anything.
1.9.7.1. Con: There is no evidence proving that humans were created by a mindless force of evolution, and there is overwhelming evidence that many have found the mind of the creator can be reasonably discerned.
1.9.7.1.1. Con: There is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community to support the claim all life on earth is the result of [Evolution.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution)
1.9.8. Pro: Humans have an awareness and understanding that produces a capacity of empathy. Therefore humans are equipped to see the distress of others who are distressed. Therefore humans are naturally more comfortable in absence of the distress necessitating a non-vegan lifestyle.
1.9.8.1. Con: The human distaste for animal suffering and distress is not that profound given that meat-eating has endured over thousands of years.
1.9.8.1.1. Con: Even though there has always been people who are not sufficiently distressed by animal suffering to bear upon their lifestyle choices, it does not mean that those who do live vegan lifestyle because of the awareness of the distress it necessitates, are not naturally more comfortable to do so.
1.9.8.1.2. Con: Humans go to great lengths to conceal or lessen the savageness of animal exploitation, even crafting laws to punish the ones whose treatment of animals is seen to be abuse. Therefore humans naturally are more comfortable in the absence of the distress caused for non-vegan lifestyles, even though the rewards for that distress have outweighed their desire to see the distress.
1.9.8.1.2.1. Pro: Animal exploiters have crafted many concepts throughout history to lessen the validity of any objection on behalf of an animal's distress. Some have even proposed theories that animals do not feel pain or distress, being directly at odds with observable animal behaviour. It shows that humans are more comfortable in absence of the distress of animals because they even prefer to delude themselves in order to escape the discomfort of the awareness that the animals are distressed.
1.9.8.2. Pro: Humans feel [at least as much empathy towards animals](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175303711X13159027359764) as they do towards other humans.
1.10. Pro: If someone is vegan for health reasons \(like being allergic to animal products\), then it's an inalienable right for them to be vegan.
1.10.1. Pro: People have the right to avoid physical harm, such as avoiding an allergic reaction.
1.10.1.1. Pro: To argue otherwise would be to deny a person's natural right to self-preservation.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: In [North Carolina v Ayers](https://www.johnlocke.org/update/self-preservation-is-the-most-basic-and-fundamental-natural-right-any-individual-possesses/) it was held that the right to self-preservation is the most fundamental of all human rights.
1.10.1.1.2. Pro: The right to self-preservation is the logical extension of the right to life.
1.10.2. Con: Being allergic to animal products may be viewed as a type of disability. Yet disabled people do not have an absolute right to having their disabilities catered to by others.
1.10.2.1. Pro: The UK's [Equality Act 2010](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/what-are-the-different-types-of-discrimination/duty-to-make-reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-people/) imposes a duty on organisations to make only "reasonable adjustments" for disabled people.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: The duty only applies where a disabled person is placed at a [substantial disadvantage](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/what-are-the-different-types-of-discrimination/duty-to-make-reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-people/) without such "reasonable adjustments". It will not always be the case that those allergic to animal products are suffering a substantial disadvantage.
1.10.3. Con: There is little evidence that someone can be allergic to all possible animal products. Therefore, proposing that a natural right to veganism exists based on health reasons cannot be sustained in practice.
1.10.3.1. Pro: While all animal proteins can theoretically be allergens, in practice the ability of some such proteins to be allergens depends on their [evolutionary distance from the human equivalent](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071015081742.htm). This suggests that some animal products are unlikely to cause someone allergies.
1.10.4. Pro: Eating meat may have negative health consequences.
1.10.4.1. Con: How humans are meant to behave is not necessarily defined by what is best for their human health.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: Many people would derive meaning from some of their habits despite the fact that they are not conducive to their health.
1.10.4.1.1.1. Pro: Smoking a cigar on special occasions is bad for one's health, yet many would feel that doing so makes it more meaningful and momentous.
1.10.4.1.2. Con: If a person's behaviour is harming their personal health, it is right to question whether the behaviour is violating their natural right to live a full, healthy life as nature intended. For instance, depression can cause self-injury and even risk suicide. Most lawmakers agree that if a cure for depression can prevent self injury, it should be forcibly applied even when the person does not want it.
1.10.4.1.3. Pro: An abnormal health condition can result in a risk to a person's life if they were to live a normal lifestyle. In context of veganism, if a person's digestive system has become unable to sustain life without eating meat, there is an unnatural conflict between the human's right to live versus the animal's right to live, where the vegan cannot ultimately choose to preserve the life of both.
1.10.4.1.3.1. Con: It should be argued that the right to live with good conscience qualifies the right to take one's own life.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Processed meats are classified as a [Group 1 carcinogen](https://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/) by the World Health Organisation, causing an 18% risk increased risk of bowel cancer.
1.10.4.3. Pro: [Some evidence](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-beef-with-red-meat) shows a link between high intake of red and processed meats and an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and premature death.
1.10.4.3.1. Con: The evidence [merely establishes a link between 'high' consumption](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-beef-with-red-meat) of red meat. Thus, it may still be possible to eat red meat infrequently and not increase the chances of poorer health outcomes.
1.10.4.3.2. Pro: It is [probable](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/red-meat-and-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer/) that eating a lot of red meat increases risk of bowel cancer.
