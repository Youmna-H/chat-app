an individual should be free to choose any food they want to eat \(without interference\).	0_1.1.	An individual should be free to choose any food they want to eat \(without interference\).	con	Being vegan could motivate or inspire other people to become vegan of their own volition.	This sentiment problematically suggests that we can all act as we wish to, regardless of the harm caused to others. If this were the case, any immoral action could be justifiable on grounds of personal freedom.	It can both be the case that someone ought to do something and that they should remain free not to do it if they wish. Thus, it may be the case that one ought to be vegan and yet should remain free not to be vegan if they so choose.	Choices are and will always be limited.	It is speciesist to grant humans the right to eat meat on grounds of their enjoyment or freedom when raising cattle for human consumption necessitates depriving these animals of the same rights to freedom and enjoyment.	It's a loaded statement, a ["begging the question" fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/53/Begging-the-Question) where the word 'food' is used to make the statement seem reasonable. So, yes humans should be free to choose any food they wish, but not animals \(which in reality are not food\).	The most commonly agreed benefit of veganism is morality, yet it is [not undisputed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/pop-psych/201311/curious-case-vegan-moral-hypocrisy). Claiming that all humans should become vegan is therefore no more justified than insisting that all people follow a single religious teaching.	Since coercion is not justified there is no way to make all humans stop eating meat.	Food preferences are a personal choice, as morality is personal and people are free to decide what is the right and wrong food after listening to their conscience.	Veganism is a choice and should not be forced on children until they are old enough to decide for themselves.	If everyone wants to eat vegan it'll be free will that gets us there, rather than being a hindrance to it.	Many people gain substantial happiness from their non-vegan diet.	Over the course of history, humans have evolved to become omnivores and this can no longer be changed.	Free humans who are adequately informed and supported would make the correct choice, whatever that may be. This conversation is intended to find what that correct choice is, not decide top-down what we should force on individuals.	Society should protect, and not get in the way of, an individual's freedom of choice.	It is immoral to restrict the rights of other humans to eat animals, so long as in doing so they do not infringe on the rights of other humans.	Unlike many examples of immoral behaviour such as homicide, whether eating meat constitutes an immoral act is not widely agreed-upon. In such cases where a consensus opinion is lacking, it seems questionable that arbitrary moral standards should be applied.	Saying that everybody should do something because somebody else thinks this is good is a mix of arrogance and ignorance.

Animals are killed in inhumane ways by predators like lions, eagles, and so on in nature.

We have the higher thinking to understand we are taking a life and that we have other food options, that is what makes it morally wrong.	The reason why humans kill less animals is because there is a proportionally smaller population of humans to all the animals who eat meat in the world, not because humans are more moral in killing animals.	Some methods that carnivores have for eating are actually beneficial for an ecosystem.	What goes on in nature is irrelevant in this case because veganism is about reducing the harm caused by humans.	With regard to the definition \([1st one](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/humane)\) of humane, killing perfectly healthy animals just because of preference or taste is neither tender nor compassionate and shows no sympathy for the animal. There is no way to kill a human humanely, nor an animal.	Predators often [wound prey and let it die for hours or days](https://io9.gizmodo.com/9-predators-with-the-most-brutal-hunting-techniques-510100768) to get an easy prey in the wild, so humans eating an animal through killing it quickly and with as little pain as possible would be more ethical than this.	The amount of animals killed by humans are way smaller than the "natural" biosystem altogether, so these minor amounts are marginal in the overall larger picture.	Humans have technology to kill animals more ethically than we our any animal could in nature to the point it creates such minimal harm that it's not unethical at that point.

True, that is why veganism works, because people's rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is infringed due to the few people that want to eat meat.	It is immoral to restrict the rights of animals in order to give humans more rights \(especially when humans do not need animals to live\).	The well-being of people has more value than the well-being of animals.	Whether or not humans are "restricted" from eating meat does change that they morally should not do so. As an analogy, in a society with free speech you are not restricted from saying horrible things about other people or lies, but it does not change that you should not do so.	There is no right that allows us inflict unnecessary suffering on anyone. Not on animals, not on humans. While restricting the rights of other humans to eat animals is immoral, what is truly immoral here is mass murder of animals that is happening at the moment. Thus, the right of the animal to live trumps the right of humans to eat animals, due to a greater morality priority.	It is immoral to restrict the rights of other humans to eat anything \(including vegan food\), yet it still happens. If humans weren't restricted in what they eat, then there may be more vegans.	No one's stopped from making their own decisions when going vegan, as they'll come to it through their own free will. They'll still eat what they want, but through a vegan framework.

Some humans are born with disorders that greatly reduce their cognitive / physical abilities, yet we do not deem it ethical to kill humans of much lesser intelligence. We currently base the value of an animal on its species, not its abilities, intelligence or sentience.	Intelligence and emotional comprehension are hard to measure and all such measurements are taken from a human point of view, so it's only natural that humans come out on top in such comparisons. Vegans base their moral considerations on empathy \(recognizing that non-human animals have many of the same needs as humans as well as the capability to suffer\) instead of pseudo-objective measurements of intelligence.	Emotional comprehension's just one factor. The benefit that they bring to the world and others has value too.

The remaining livestock on farms if everyone became vegan right now would pose a serious issue. The reproduction of the herd wouldn't stop and the excess of animals would be very harmful to nature if they are released into the wild.	We eat the meat of farmed animals, not wild animals.

Vegan morality is inconsistent and hypocritical in valuing one life \(animals\) over another \(plants, fungi, and microbes\).	con	Killing is bad, but inevitable for producing food. Thus, the smallest number of organisms ought to be killed for food. It is better to kill only the vegetation to feed a man than to kill the vegetation to feed a cow and then kill the cow to feed the man. By reducing intermediaries, veganism preserves the most life, even if all life is to be valued equally.	Humans consider animal pain to be more important than plant pain only because of the former's proximity to their lived experience. This is an anthropocentric bias.	Plants are not the same as humans, as they are autotrophs, and thus do not require the destruction of life in their consumption practices \(unless it's a carnivorous exception\).	Valuing animals above plants depends on their similarity to us and is therefore based on an anthropocentric bias. This defeats the implicit aim of veganism by assuming that humans are superior, which gives us reign to harm non-humans for our own benefit. A less anthropocentric veganism would value all life in parallel to human and animal life, rendering all human behaviour immoral by virtue of the way in which we treat bacteria, plants etc. in order to sustain ourselves.	An "all or nothing" approach [is logically fallacious](http://www.academia.edu/21565174/Fallacy_All_or_Nothing) and hinders progression in the field of animal rights and ethics. Nowadays, social and political change is achieved through reforms, not revolutions. This means we don't need to have everything figured out before we can start working on improving and protecting animals' lives.	In reality, everyone has different moral standards for different species, not just vegans. The vast majority of people do not consider plants to be as morally significant as animals. If given the choice between cutting the stems of a dozen daisies or cutting off a dog's head, the average person will choose to kill the daisies without hesitation.	This is consistent with [Indigenous teachings](https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/what-is-the-relationship-between-indigenous-peoples-and-animals) which value the lives of humans, animals, bugs, and plants equally.	Studies around plants' feelings and senses, and our [understanding of such topics is extremely limited](http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/062208/do-plants-have-brains); and our current point of view seems to be based on the complexity \([1](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/plants-use-neurotransmitter-signal-stress/), [2](https://www.crcpress.com/Neurotransmitters-in-Plant-Life/Roshchina/p/book/9781578081424), [3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-28516-8_10)\) or non-existence of a typical nervous system despite there still being stimuli in plants.

This claim seems to assume that anthropocentrism is antonym to veganism, which is not, [veganism is](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) just and only against explotation and cruelty towards animals, not against the evolution theory, biological categorizations or other scientific findings.

it is possible to consume meat in an ethical way.	0_1.2.9.1.	It is possible to consume meat in an ethical way.	con	Meat derived from living animals can only be consumed by excising it from the animals, which involves slaughter or mutilation, both of which involve unavoidable moral harms.	There is a moral argument to stop eating meat altogether \(as well as fish and animal derived products\): animals are sentient beings with a will to live, and it is therefore more ethical to avoid inflicting suffering to other animals, for the same reason as it is more ethical to avoid inflicting suffering to other human beings.	[Free range chickens](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/30/free-range-eggs-con-ethical) are still slaughtered, selectively bred for rapid growth to a point where for some, their legs can't support them, and kept in overcrowded barns. Free Range doesn't equal a happy life for the animal.	Scientific advancements are making ethical alternatives increasingly possible for those wishing to taste meat without creating moral harms.	Bans on eating certain meats to treat animals fairly \(like protecting endangered species\) create a new ethical issue in themselves: a legal justification for eating meat \(by sideswiping its ethical problems\) through [carnism](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/carnism-why-eating-animals-is-a-social-justice-issue/). This would make oppressive speciesism \(as it favors one species over another\) socially acceptable, which is avoidable if we go vegan.	One can eat local meat and animal products without patronizing any products from the industrial meat production industry.	Animal product consumption is not inherently unethical, only causing undue or excessive suffering is. If the industry can be improved to minimise/eliminate suffering, then there is no ethical basis behind condemning it.	The argument that the meat industry 'could be more ethical' is greatly a weak one because there is a big difference between 'could be' and 'will be'.	The meat production industry being unethical might imply that all humans should become vegetarian, but it does not imply that all humans should become vegan. The ethics of the meat production industry are only relevant to the ethics of eating meat, not the ethics of eating other animal products.

There are multiple forms of agriculture and organic farming with animal welfare in mind. [Biodynamic agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture) is one example.	The majority of consumers prioritize the cost and ease of meat rather than the ethics of production. Just because a minority choose to carefully select their produce, does not compensate for a majority who do not.	Some situations make that impractical. For instance, industrial meat from developed countries is cheaper than local meat in developing countries, hindering its local meat production if sold there. Economic imbalances can then happen, forcing markets to resort to selling factory over local meat and consumers no choice but to buy factory meat instead.	It would not be possible for everyone to eat as much meat as they want without using the meat processing industry.

Going against the laws could get people into legal trouble.	Many chickens have been bred to produce more eggs than is healthy for them to do so. This is because their calcium can become [severely depleted](https://mikethechickenvet.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/bones-shells-and-hen-health/), and it is difficult to feed them enough to overcome this.	Most backyard chickens are hens \(females\). Most of the cocks \(males\) will have been killed at hatching.	Most backyard chickens are still killed for food once they stop laying frequently.	While keeping a single chicken may well not be cruel the demand for meat far outstrips that. It is not feasible to support the world on this small scale farming, thus by not being vegan humans are forced to turn to crueler methods.	Even in supposedly ethical free-range backyard farming where chickens are not harmed, other animals might be: chickens are omnivores so may consume or otherwise impact insects and other wildlife where they are kept, and thereby disrupt the native ecosystem/food chain there.

Veganism [kills more animals](http://theconversation.com/ordering-the-vegetarian-meal-theres-more-animal-blood-on-your-hands-4659) than it saves.	con	That entirely depends on the type of crop, and a study on [field deaths in plant agriculture](https://philarchive.org/archive/FISFDI) shows that deaths can be eliminated altogether.	Many animals are [killed in the production](https://www.morehouse.edu/facstaff/nnobis/papers/Davis-LeastHarm.htm) of plant-based food, including rabbits, mice, hamsters and other rodents, ground-nesting birds, deer fawn, snakes, etc.	Morally speaking, there is a huge difference between accidentally killing and killing on purpose. Not to mention the imprisonment, forced insemination, robbing their offspring, painfully living, etc, to which farm animals are submitted unlike collateral victims of agriculture.	A balanced, responsible, ethical and sustainable agriculture where no animal is killed exists.	For a vegan diet, [more animals have to die](https://carnivoreaurelius.com/veganism-kills/) than for a carnivore diet. Agriculture is by definition the killing of any living being on a piece of land to grow just one plant.	In a vegan world, many animals that are currently farmed and subsequently eaten would either live in worse conditions or never get the chance to live at all. For a significant number of animals, a vegan world would be a worse outcome for them.

If crops are grown in a way that doesn't kill animals \(indoor, hydroponic farming; cultured plant cells, like cultured meat; etc.\) or if the crops that are most detrimental to local fauna are avoided, then this issue is negated.	The harm from producing crops is offset by crops that double as wildlife reserves \(like [rice paddies](https://www.manomet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Rice-Fields-for-Wildlife-Folk-et-al-2016-compressed.pdf)\).	If more investment in production of plant-based food could be made, allied to cellular agriculture and the notion that animal life is as valuable, we as a global society would learn effective ways to produce animal products without slaughtering farmed livestock and sacrificing the animals that die in plant-based cultures.	For raising animals, you need plants and while producing this you also kill the mice and snakes that live there.

Humans actually help more than take by protecting, curing, feeding, nurturing, and prolonging them/their offspring's lives in exchange for meat that they won't need or use after their death.	All animals are eventually killed, whether by humans or other animals or nature. Meat producers [usually want](http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/cattle-stress.html) animals to die quickly to prevent pain-associated chemicals from forming, as they spoil the meat. Thus, they use the most humane means possible.	It's better for an animal to live a short life than no life at all, assuming any amount of life to be a net positive.	Domesticated animals, livestock and other animals that depend on humans would starve to death.	There is no reason to believe that these animals would live in worse conditions in a vegan world. As for not getting the chance to live, it is arguably better than living a short and unpleasant life. Besides, not being born is not usually seen as a harm - on the contrary, we often practice birth control on ourselves and other animals because overpopulation is a concern.	Breeding and raising animals for no purpose \(since we wouldn't eat them in a vegan world\) would come at some expense. So it's a worse condition overall than if we don't add more animals to the world that don't need to be here.	That's only a temporary situation, the 'worse conditions', as when those animals are gone, then there are no animals around to have a chance to live in poor conditions.	The reproductive strategy that farmers evolutionarily impose on livestock \(a.k.a. [artificial selection](http://www.innovateus.net/innopedia/what-are-benefits-artificial-selection)\) makes them more successful than their predecessors \(outliving them, with like [cattle](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/130401_beef) and [chicken/turkeys](https://www.kent.ac.uk/news/science/3384/chickens-closer-to-dinosaurs-than-other-birds)\) and perhaps any animal within their [taxonomic class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28biology%29) on Earth. This [mutualistic](https://sciencing.com/symbiotic-relationship-8794702.html) symbiotic relationship is beautiful, benefits both humans and farm animals, and there is no reason to destroy it.	For the animals we bring into this world, many others don't get the chance to be born because of it. So we're not really helping more lives be born insomuch as deciding who gets to be born.

For dairy cows this fraction is ~0.25 and for chickens raised for meat 0.02 \([hsi.org.au](https://hsi.org.au/go/to/70/farm-animal-welfare.html#.WtTolIhuaM8)\).	Farming practices should not be described as "protecting" animals and "taking care of offspring" when it inevitably leads to the death of the animals and their offspring for the financial gain of the producer.	There's no such thing as ethical killing. If animals are taken care only for the purpose of killing them that is ethically wrong when there is an alternative.	The non-industrialized production and use of dairy products \(milk and eggs\) is not innately exploitative or unethical because domesticated animals do not suffer, but are are rather fed, nurtured, and protected by the humans that raise them in a mutually beneficial process.	Even if a farmed animal is treated well, the amount of lives negatively impacted by its existence is still very high. Species who are going extinct because of deforestation to make room for farmland, animals killed in the harvesting of the many crops you need to feed a single animal. Even cats have become a burden on many ecosystems, threatening rodent and bird populations. You're exchanging one arguably good life for dozens of others.	Caring for an animal and eating its flesh after it has died from natural causes would be ethical.	Humane farming is only marginally better than traditional animal agriculture, yet notoriously hard to implement because of backlash from the industry and consumers who fear [rising prices](https://www.ethicalfarmingfund.org/post/2018/05/30/the-truth-behind-the-price-of-humanely-raised-food).	Selective breeding methods, which are inherent to animal farming, are immoral.

A farmed animal is given life, allocated land resources and food resources to support it.	A farmed animal does not have to live in constant fear of predation as it does in the wild.	A farmed animal can be provided with a life that is worth living. Free-range farming with an enhanced environment to stimulate the animals is possible, so that the animals' life is worth living.	This statement assumes that adding livestock is net positive life. However, in reality, it is not. Adding their lives come at the sacrifice of others \(namely wildlife and humans - due to climate change\). This makes adding farm life net negative when factoring in all variables.	If the livestock do not take up land, then it would get filled by other lifeforms \(plants, fungi, wild animals, and maybe even humans\). One lifeform's loss is another one's gain. Thus the addition of livestock is net neutral at most, but most likely net negative.	Putting animals in a [catch-22](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch-22), where they lose either way \(having no life, or have a bad life and dying early\) are equally terrible and not worth it. Neither are good options nor real choices, as the chance for a good life is too small. The best option is a good, long life with a natural, uninfluenced death if we choose to breed them, not a short life.

This highly subjective criteria of happiness is not sufficient for deciding when to end an animal's life until we have a better understanding of how and what animals feel.	If we allow animals to live long and fulfilled lives before eating them, raising and killing them for food would be a lot less economically feasible, leading to a major drop in the availability of animal products \(or extremely increased prices\), which would in turn lead to an almost-vegan diet anyways.	Free-range is an [elastic term](https://youtu.be/NxvQPzrg2Wg?t=5m4s), meaning that the definition is arbitrary and can be changed. Likely free-range will not be [much better or more ethical](https://youtu.be/NxvQPzrg2Wg?t=5m4s) than conventional farming \(if we don't account for the environment\).	From the animal's perspective, there is no purpose to their existence.

The only value that the animal's life is worth living for is for humans \(like the farmer\).

Veganism accepts valuing humans/animals over other lifeforms, which is almost as bad as omnivores accepting valuing humans over animal/other lifeforms.	con	Humans require food to live and all known food sources require consuming some other organism. Veganism values life more than non-veganism as non-veganism kills organisms to feed livestock and then kills the livestock to feed humans. In contrast, veganism kills only the vegetation.	Valuing animals above plants depends on their similarity to us and is therefore based on an anthropocentric bias. This defeats the implicit aim of veganism by assuming that humans are superior, which gives us reign to harm non-humans for our own benefit. A less anthropocentric veganism would value all life in parallel to human and animal life, rendering all human behaviour immoral by virtue of the way in which we treat bacteria, plants etc. in order to sustain ourselves.	Vegans' morality/ethics is always linked to animals we have empathy with, where we recognize ourselves as similar in the line of evolution, like mammals, fishes, birds, etc. It is acceptable to kill other kinds of lifelike non-pathogenic microbes or even vegetables, when no empathic sense is developed. Then, moral discourse just protects part of life, not life itself.	Veganism's morality is detrimental and exploitative to lifeforms outside of animals.	Vegan morality is inconsistent and hypocritical in valuing one life \(animals\) over another \(plants, fungi, and microbes\).	The premise that omnivores always value humans over animals is not always true. For instance, animals are not held to the same moral standards as humans. As a result, animals live freer lives which indicates that their lives are valued more than humans.	Without plants, humans would not be able to survive. Just about everything comes from them. To think of them poorly is degrading, as they provide more value at times than people and animals do.	Plants are our ancestors \(we share [half our DNA with bananas](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/humans-share-50-dna-bananas-2482139)\).

Veganism's morality is detrimental and exploitative to lifeforms outside of animals.	con	Veganism is, at the very least, no more detrimental to non-animal life than current widespread non-vegan agricultural practices. There is good reason to think it would be significantly less detrimental than such practices.	Killing wild plants affects entire ecosystems \(including wildlife and native cultures\), especially to the point that a major food source goes away. An example of this is cutting down trees that take a long time if ever to bear fruit if replanted \(such as [acorn trees in a drought-prone environment](https://www.kcet.org/shows/tending-the-wild/episodes/tending-the-wild)\).	Many plant species go extinct or endangered due to exploiting plants, especially in the essential oil industry with rare plants like [sandalwood](http://www.tambela.com/articles/sandalwood.php).	This impacts all life on Earth. For example, if a plant is not preserved in the Amazon due to deforestation for a crop, that plant cannot be examined to find it to be a[pharmaceutical breakthrough](http://rain-tree.com/) for a major disease.	Vegan ethics provide no protection for organisms outside the animal kingdom, such as unicellular and non-animal multi-cellular organisms.	Giving animals moral consideration is still better than not respecting the needs of other living beings at all. No one said veganism was the end all be all, we will still need to adapt and evolve our ethics continuously as science gives us more insight on what it means to be alive and sentient.	"Murdering" a carrot and murdering a dog are different acts. The argument that these are morally different hinges on sentience. It's the same reason turning off the life support machine sustaining a brain-dead patient is considered more acceptable than not treating a mentally alive person who would otherwise die from an illness. A body without consciousness doesn't care about what is done to it and has no sense of itself to lose, so its moral claim can't be equated with a sentient life's claim.

That is, it argues that veganism will be the moral choice when the effective majority agrees it is.	Even if people try, they might revert back to eating meat out of habit or subconscious actions that people are unaware of \(like still going to a favorite steakhouse without remembering that they are vegan now\). Thus, without taking motivation into consideration \(making sure people want to be vegan\) first, the worldwide vegan change would not last permanently.	Demand for veganism will follow action if everyone goes vegan and the right motivators are in place \(like advertisements and convenience\). Thus, demand for meat shouldn't stop the world from trying to go vegan.

Killing animals for food is a [survival instinct](http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43484), and so not inherently unethical or morally blameworthy.	con	"Civilisation" can be defined as the ongoing process of overriding and moving away from our instinctual drivers for survival \(as individuals or as a species\) towards more rational and moral behaviors.	Early modern humans were more prey than predator then, evolving instincts to repulse animals \(like [phobias](https://hubpages.com/health/list-of-animal-phobias), [fight-or-flight](https://psychcentral.com/blog/whats-the-purpose-of-the-fight-or-flight-response/), [patternicity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns/), and [anxiety](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_evolution/2012/10/evolution_of_anxiety_humans_were_prey_for_predators_such_as_hyenas_snakes.html)\), not those to kill them.

This and its [habitual progression](https://www.animallaw.info/article/link-cruelty-animals-and-violence-towards-people) make humans killing animals [immoral and unethical](http://www.straypetadvocacy.org/PDF/AnimalCrueltyLaws.pdf).	One cannot be blamed for being born with or not knowing any better, but that does not make wrongdoing any more acceptable. However, instinctive behavior becomes immoral and unethical when we know better, as at that point we can choose.	Instinctive, natural behavior is counterproductive can create problems, both for the individual and society, and both might want it removed. If both deem it immoral and unethical, then it is it as such and the unwanted behaviors should be shied away from and hopefully removed if possible.	Just because we cannot change what a current status is, doesn't mean we cannot learn from and change our circumstances for a better future. People might not deserve blame for being immoral or unethical, but their actions can. Luckily actions can be changed.	Just because something is natural does not mean that it is good. This is the [appeal to nature fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/36/Appeal-to-Nature).	In nature, animals kill each other without considering the life they end's significance. Nature's unethical in this regard, and we can't change how it is. However, if we don't want this to continue, then we shouldn't act like this \(as we can do something about ourselves\) to make it acceptable, just because it is in nature.	People do not have a natural instinct to kill animals for food.

A vegan society offers the best way to manage resources.	None of us would be here without meat. The abundance we have now to make vegan choices may not be around in the future. It may save our lives yet in case in times of famine/ration \(such as a natural or nuclear disaster\). People will not have choices then, just like they did not in the past.	Not in every way does it restrict societal growth in terms of productivity and size, just redirects it in a different direction \(that provides benefits not currently seen\).	To date, no \(entirely\) vegan civilizations have been able to sustain themselves across a long period of time.	People learn about animals through non-vegan activities, like eating meat, having pets, visiting zoos, and hunting. Taking those activities away would make vegans less aware of animals due to less interactions with them.	Population growth is not a goal in itself to strive for. Quality of life is a better goal. This might require a lower population.	Not all growth of human civilization is positive, sustainable, or desired, so we shouldn't keep those around. What's better is civilization taking the action needed to be where it should be to reach its potential \(and if that means veganism, so be it\), even if it does come at the cost of growth.	Many of our achievements as a civilization have relied on controlling our violent and destructive tendencies and being compassionate instead. Choosing non-violence \(or minimal violence\) when it comes to our food is the next logical step in the development of a civilized population that grows beyond its biological instincts.	Animal consumption \(or anything for that matter\) restricts civilization growth too. So it's not a reason for civilization not to go vegan. Instead, if the benefits outweigh the costs, then that's what will matter in knowing what to decide upon.

Depopulation is beneficial to the humanity's survival, as it will help sustain the human population at a steady rate.	Vegans, with their healthier diet and lifestyles, will [tend to live longer](https://prime.peta.org/2012/11/longer). Depopulation is fine then, because the slower birth rate will even out with the longer ages.	Depopulation with veganism is beneficial to humankind, because the longer people live, the more resources they use. Lower population numbers allows the vegans alive to better utilize the resources around them, as they would not have to compete with newer people for the same resources.	A vegan diet has been shown to [lower fertility](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/mens-health/11172519/Vegetarians-have-much-lower-sperm-counts.html), making a task of reproduction \(one of the [key functions of any living organism](http://www.web-formulas.com/Biology_Topics/Living_Organism_and_Its_Functions.aspx)\) more difficult to achieve. Therefore, it cannot be an optimal, or even healthy, diet for humans as species.

veganism is incompatible with some cultural beliefs and practices.	0_1.5.	Veganism is incompatible with some cultural beliefs and practices.	con	The consumption of animal products forms a fundamental part of many cultures and traditions around the world.	People would end up being pushed towards associating with cultures they don't want to and/or normally not a part of, which wouldn't be likable by them.	If all humans became vegan, then humanity would lose a big part of its collective culture. Keeping around a small portion of the culture is desirable for educational settings, re-enactments, historians, etc.	Various small and ancient cultures are getting lost/pushed out anyway to [generationalism](https://springgrovemnheritagecenter.org/a-heritage-of-questioning/foreward/) \(or lack thereof\), [globalization](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2011/10/12895/how-has-globalization-caused-a-loss-of-culture/), [modernization, and its appeal](https://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/cimac/hirai.html). So even if veganism is incompatible with these cultural beliefs and practices, that would not be an issue in the future, as they won't be around for veganism to conflict with or disrupt them.	Preventing veganism is incompatible with some cultural beliefs and practices, so if we do not want to limit culture, we should not limit veganism.	There are no prohibitions for eating meat in the [10 commandments](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ten-Commandments). Therefore, it is not fundamentally incompatible with Christianity or Judaism.	Some cultures have non-vegan traditions.	Just because something is a cultural practice or deeply believed doesn't make it right or ethical. Ethics should always be more important than culture, tradition, or beliefs.	[Appeal to tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) is a logical fallacy.	Veganism is [more associated with liberals than conservatives or moderates](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/without-prejudice/201809/meat-eating-and-political-ideology). This may equate to, if non-liberals go vegan, associating with liberals more. This would take them away from their identity, beliefs, and ultimately participation in affiliated groups.	Even if the world went vegan, many people might retain their meat-eating cultural beliefs and memories. For these people, a vegan lifestyle may be impossible to sustain long term.	Veganism conflicts with religious beliefs and practices that people already have.	Lifestyles with a lot of focus on purity \(such as [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism), [Straight Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_edge), [Raw-Veganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_veganism) or [Breatharianism](https://raymaor.com/breatharian-life-faq/)\) may never be mainstream, because "mainstream" by definition - in our culture - [appeals to the lowest common denominator](https://www.theonion.com/lowest-common-denominator-continues-to-plummet-1819566022), in order to reach [the most people possible](https://www.rapidtvnews.com/201011038613/ccr-forces-itv-to-chase-lowest-common-denominator-audiences.html#axzz5QDdSGIHA) without any scope at all.

In [Mi’kmaq culture](https://humanrightsareanimalrights.com/2015/04/03/margaret-robinson-indigenous-veganism-feminist-natives-do-eat-tofu/), the killing of a moose symbolized a boy’s entry into manhood. So when you challenge the hunting traditions, you’re challenging how Mi’kmaq men understand their masculinity.	Cultural traditions centered around meat \(like hunting, ritual slaughter for certain spiritual / religious events\) are not the main focus of veganism. Although vegan ethics would dictate the abolishment of such practices, the vegan movement is currently more concerned with animal agriculture on a large, global scale. A small native tribe owning a herd of goats is a relatively small problem and vegans are not trying to take away animals from people who actually depend on them.	In [South Korea](https://www.vegansisters.org/travel/vegan-traveller-south-korea/), for example, it is quite difficult to stay on a vegan diet as meat, fish and egg is very prevalent. For example, the stock for any Korean soup consists of dried anchovies.	Veganism is [incompatible with Inuit culture](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/01/animal-rights-activists-inuit-clash-canada-indigenous-food-traditions), where \(sustainable and respectful\) seal hunting has been a part of their lives for centuries.

"more poverty of the rural areas" - as you have described an area to be in poverty then that should include all living species within that area, of which include thousands of animals. The argumentation here is based on animal life having no value but commodity, and human life is the only one of importance. 'Poverty' can come in many forms and be applies to many lives.	Raising livestock makes poverty worse in rural areas than crops do, because livestock is less sustainable, ruining the land quicker until there is not much left, leaving people with no other means to keep their jobs going.

Use of animals in farming initially made use of underutilized fibres, indigestible to humans, and still does so \([1](https://qknowbooks.gitbooks.io/jhs_1_science-farming-systems/mixed_farming.html)\).

Thus, the use of animals is not only more cost effective for agrarian communities, but often necessary.

There are stringent rules and radical changes associated with veganism that are too difficult for the average person to easily incorporate into their lives.	con	Being vegan means "[A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism); etc." Thus, veganism only involves doing what is practicably possible, and so cannot by definition impose demands that are too difficult to meet.	The fact that something is difficult is not an excuse. If a person defers to the idea of it being the case, that is a choice in itself, a self-enacting postulate, and in essence amounts to active self-deceit based on either weakness, laziness, lecherousness, spite, or immorality - all of which are reprehensible in the context. A person can do it, it is a matter of them effectively choosing not to.	Veganism, unlike what [most people believe](https://selecthealth.org/blog/2019/10/breaking-5-myths-about-being-vegan), is very [easy to adopt](http://features.peta.org/how-to-go-vegan/) and absolutely [feasible](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/cost-vegan-diet-international-perspective).	The definition of veganism used in this discussion is arbitrary and has no end, as it asks adherents to reduce the exploitation of animals as much as possible. This makes the cutoffs \(of what veganism is/is not\) difficult to define and thus hard to follow.	Veganism has many similarities with [religion](https://medium.com/tenderlymag/is-veganism-a-religion-f195e1c23954), suggesting it has the potential to become too rigid, extreme, or intolerant of difference to be practicable on a global scale.	People can make minimal, practically unnoticeable vegan substitutions to their non-vegan lifestyle; so they won't notice enough to worry or miss out on its favorable aspects.	There is no quick fix for humanity's largest challenges. Abandoning progress altogether because of that would not make sense.	Veganism is [not just](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) abstaining from eating meat but also not using anything which uses animal products. This is an unrealistic standard as animal based products are unavoidable.	One would need almost expert-level knowledge of nutrition and skills to apply those concepts on a daily basis to themselves to maintain a vegan diet. Not everyone has these these abilities and as such could fail to get adequate nutrition levels to truly sustain themselves on it.	If everyone is vegan, those who find it difficult will have an infrastructure and support system to help them through the ups and downs of a vegan diet. So it may be impossible in this world, but not so much in a vegan society.	Following the ethical logic of veganism creates a high moral standard that humans would struggle to adapt to.	Real personal experiences and preferences in allowing veganism in their lives reveal that it's unrealistic and impractical for everyone in reality.

It is explicit in its unboundedness and lack of specifics, defined thus to allow for a set of moral principles that are not subject to contemporary science, industry, technological capabilities. "As far as is possible and reasonable" does not stand in relation to the individual, but to the set of general circumstances that envelop the individual. In the same wording it also mandates pressing on, improving on our capacities, to minimise it even further.	The vegetarian diet is easier to follow, as the definition is more concrete and objective. Foods can be scientifically analyzed to decide what is vegetarian or not. This compares to the definition of veganism, which is looser and more subjective in its interpretation.	The definition is centered around animals and not people's health, which makes it more difficult for people to stick to it.	For some, veganism means abstaining from all products from animals, including those that lived and died naturally.	The cutoff \(of what veganism is and is not\) might be definitive after all.	The definition used here is [pragmatic](http://www.flanderstoday.eu/living/vegan-visionary-preaches-pragmatism-instead-moralising), rather than dogmatic, and thus is actually easier to follow then other forms of veganism.	[Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) is taken on an individual basis \("as far as possible and practicable"\) This premeditated flexibility makes Veganism feasible for most people and circumstances.	The obscurity and lack of understanding the definition \(through its vagueness\) creates enough confusion to prevent people from having viability in making the decisions required for being vegan.	Arbitrary definitions should not stop the world from going vegan, as their nature allows them to be reformed. Thus, we can change the definition, through refining, what veganism is so that the world can actually adhere to it without conflict and confusion.	Having an arbitrary definition creates issues that push veganism into being short-lived or prevent it from emerging. We should not waste our time until the issues are resolved and the vegan movement can sustain itself into the long-term.	Because the definition's focus is on reduction and not elimination, animal exploitation could still take place.	-> See discussion #10281: There is no such thing as "vegan"

Animal based products are not unavoidable: from food to clothes, we can get everything we need without exploiting animals. With the increasing number of vegans, vegan products are becoming increasingly available as well. A proof of this is the very fact that thousands of vegans around the world live their life without buying animal products.	Even if animal products were unavoidable, veganism advocates [the reduction](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-there-no-such-thing-as-vegan-127588) 'as far as is possible and practicable'.	Veganism is a radical solution to the issues surrounding over-consumption of animal products in privileged societies.

Many humans, especially those in poverty, live in [food deserts](http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts/).

So in reality, it is the lesser-privileged societies that are more vegan, rather than the other way around.	Eating meat continuously is even more difficult to attain, due to their ability to create crises \(economic, politically, socially, etc., like in [China](https://youtu.be/rLR9TEUMgM8?t=273)\).

There are many other ways, apart from giving up meat, to reduce the environmental impact a person has.	Consuming the nutrient level for a typical body type on a vegan diet is better environmentally than one that doesn't account consumption levels.	Selfishness, especially towards materialism and consumerism truly tarnishes the environment. Vegans may engage in other behaviours that are more harmful to the environment than any benefit they create, as they're being justified through the psychological phenomenon known as [moral self-licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing).	Global over-population is a real problem: people should be allowed to choose a diet that shortens their lifespan.

People can focus on other parts of their lifestyle that also contribute heavily to climate change first before needing to give up meat, like flying less \(for instance, [one flight](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/co2-ausstoss-beim-flugzeug-so-viel-emissionen-verursachen-flugreisen/) from Munich to Vancouver expel more than 2300 kilogram CO2\).	Billions of people eating "just a little amount of meat" is not sustainable, because it cumulatively adds up to a substantial amount in total.

This change would lead to a greater environmental benefit than just everyone going vegan.	Since being vegan is often the result of a general interest in protecting the environment and sentient life-forms from unnecessary harm, vegan lifestyle is often accompanied by other lifestyle decisions that aim to reduce harm done to the environment. Vegans are thus more likely to show a broad spectrum of behaviour that aims to protect the environment.	Just because vegans "may" engage in other destructive activities does not mean they necessarily will. It certainly does not mean people should not go vegan, since some might perfectly fine transition without falling into moral self-licensing.	People may engage as much in these behaviors anyway if they are not vegan. If they are vegan, they are providing an overall greater benefit, even when engaging in these activities.	If going vegan makes one more prone to moral self-licensing, then transitioning to veganism should be consciously paired with other eco-friendly lifestyle choices, such as avoiding flight and fossile fuel car travel.	When everyone goes vegan, then new laws may come about to discourage people from engaging in worse activities to prevent climate change from affecting their region \(like a country\) anyway. Thus, this should not be a worry.

the taste of meat is delicious and brings many people pleasure in a manner that vegetarian food cannot fully imitate.	3_1.1.	The taste of meat is delicious and brings many people pleasure in a manner that vegetarian food cannot fully imitate.	con	The demand for meat is rising globally. This clearly indicates its high popularity.	Non-meat products can offer an equivalently pleasing food experience.	Meat is convenient and consumer friendly.	Popularity and pleasure has no relevance to what is right or wrong.	Even if meat tastes good the experience overall is less desirable. First, the color scheme is not as colorful and pretty as plants. Additionally the processing needed to eat meat \(like cooking and deboning\) is more annoying than eating plants raw.	The delicious taste of meat won't last forever due to [seafood](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533125/All-seafood-will-run-out-in-2050-say-scientists.html) and [meat](http://www.quantumrun.com/prediction/vegetarians-will-reign-supreme-after-meat-shock-2035-future-food-p2) running out in the future. It's better to get used to the taste of plants than be forced to later on.	It is not clear that the additional pleasure \(if any\) of eating a meal containing meat compared to eating a meal without outweighs the suffering of the animal bred, raised and killed for their meat.	Pleasure is important to human quality of life, so if meat consumption is more pleasurable than anticipated, abstinence could have a meaningful negative impact on quality of life. The overwhelming popularity of meat throughout almost all cultures could be an indication that eating meat is enormously pleasurable.	What people commonly refer to the "taste of meat" is directly linked to one of the five basic tastes: [umami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami). This taste can also be found in vegetable foods such as miso, seaweeds, tomatoes, mushrooms and many others, thus providing an equally satisfying meal deprived of animal protein.	That the taste of meat is "pleasurable" is very subjective, and it could be argued that taste preferences can be taught and/or untaught \(trained\).	Many of man's endeavors are in pursuit of pleasure. However, some of these pleasures we derive have negative externalities, i.e. they negatively impact other people/the surrounding environment/the planet as a whole. It is in our collective interest to minimize and gradually eliminate the pursuit of such pleasures. Eating meat, though pleasurable has high impact negative externalities and should therefore be gradually eliminated. Unrestrained hedonism can be catastrophic to the commons.	Eating other animals \(human beings are animals\) is not necessary for our survival, it's for our pleasure, and this pleasure has to be balanced with the cost of the victims, which is too high \(suffering and death\).	In the most world-renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.	It is because the taste of meat is so good and popular that scientists try to imitate it and create vegetarian "meat" products.

If much of humans' behaviour is not necessary for survival, it should be judged depending on the impact of that behaviour. While much of it, such as creating and and research, do not cause harm to others, eating meat is an example where extreme harm is caused, which means the behaviour is not justified.	Unlike consumption of meat, the vast majority of all science, art, culture and languages comes without the infliction of suffering and harm to other living beings.

The chase and consumption of meat have therefore constituted a central component of human culture since its beginning.	con	Cultural components change over time: cultural transformation is a natural dynamic process.	Humans' meat consumption patterns today are not the same as those of their stone-age ancestors. Naturally, the kind of hunting and consumption of meat practised by stone-age humanoids does not, therefore, hold the same importance in modern-day culture.	Humans in industrial nations have overcome the "hunting" part of stone-age culture; there is no reason why they should not outgrow the "consumption of meat" part as well.	The [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#Subjects.2C_themes_and_patterns) found most often in cave paintings were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones. The most common animal hunting and meat consumption practices in the stone-age have not, therefore, necessarily made significant contribution to this part of human cultural history.	In our earliest origins as a species, humans needed the high amounts of energy and protein animal meat provided to power our oversized \(compared to animals\) brains. Today, in a world where food is comparatively plentiful, there is no need to turn to meat for this intake.	It would be a huge loss for humanity, if we abandoned thousands of years of culinary culture.	There are ancient vegetarian tribes, such as [Etyottydaih](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/an_ancient_vegetarian_tribe_struggles_to_keep_its_traditions_alive/).

A vegan diet would consume the plants that the animal ate, and would in the same manner indirectly consume CO2 and CH4 as you claim. The difference is that the animal becomes inefficient.

Farm animals eat grass and animal feed, which took exactly as much CO2 out of the atmosphere during growing as the animals give back during digestion.

As long as there are large cities, food production,whether animal or vegetable, will continue at large scale, and will continue to impact the environment.	Without a major devastating calamity, agriculture will not devolve back to primarily small farm production.
this does not make eating meat inherently wrong, because the massive scale of our population is the main cause of the massive scale of farming and therefore also the massive scale of green house gas emissions.	3_1.1.4.8.1.1.9.2.1.1.7.1.6.1.4.

Therefore this argument does not entail a duty to stop meat consumption.	As  vegetarian diets have a lesser impact on resources a massive adoption of vegetarian diets would contribute to a massive cut of greenhouse emissions.	Overpopulation can't be the only aspect to address green house emissions; response should be focused on life style also, becouse if it's not posible to change life style \(Diet, Housing, Mobility, Consumerism\) the only way posible to reduce emissions would be to reduce population.	Whether eating meat is inherently wrong or not, the argument is that we should stop eating it. In the context of the current situation, there is certainly a viable argument to be made that we should stop eating meat to reduce our environmental impact.	In order to find a sustainable ecological balance, in order to keep the human species alive, we must find ways of reducing and mitigating our carbon debt to the world. Abstaining from eating animal meat \(even temporarily\) will allow us more time to find solutions to this global problem.

By eating as much meat as we do now we are asking meat producers to continue what they are doing. Eating meat does result in more production and more greenhouse gas emissions.	Ceasing to eat meat would discourage further production of meat.	It does not make sense at all to see eight billion people hunting for their own meal every day.	Deflecting the Climate Change argument to argue for personally hunted meat only shifts the argument to the ethics of killing an animal for food, and attempts to detract from the very real environmental consequences of producing meat at a large scale.

So there is a significant amount of indirect CO2 emission coming from fossil source.	That's just how you define 'league'. The source of the carbon in this case is hardly relevant, it's the transformation from carbon dioxide into methane that is. The carbon in the methane does not even out with the carbon in the carbon dioxide; [methane is a 25 times stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide](https://climatechangeconnection.org/emissions/co2-equivalents/).	The Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of nitrogen fertilizer is heavily reliant on natural gas. Its use to produce feedstock means that the methane being gassed off by livestock is directly linked to mined hydrocarbons, not only from atmospheric nitrogen.	Eating in ways that are just less bad than the worst contributor do not justify supporting the runner up contributor, it just compounds the issue.

In the most world-renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.	con	If eating meat is too far abandoned before artificial replacements can suitably be found, culinary arts developed over centuries may be lost.	Something being tasty does not justify torturing animals or destroying the environment. Jeffrey Dahmer used humans as the central piece of his meals. Protecting that culinary option for him was not more important than protecting the lives of those he would destroy.	Culinary styles and traditions change and evolve over time. If the world stops eating meat, international cuisines will adapt to that fact.	Most world-renowned cuisines developed seasoning and preparations to make up for the lack of meat or mask the deficiencies of poor quality scraps. What makes them world renowned is not the meat ingredients, it's everything else around it.	Bacon. Whenever there is a debate about not eating meat, bacon is quite a strong argument for the case that eating meat brings more taste and pleasure than most plant based foods.	When meat is the main focus of a meal, it is often marinated, covered in sauces, seasonings, cheese, and vegetables to enhance its taste. It is those things that are delicious, not the meat itself.	An increase in vegetarianism would generate newer and better vegetarian foods, recipes and cooking techniques, which could rival the pleasure generated from meat-based meals.	Maybe it is not because it's the tastiest food, it could also be that it is the most exclusive, expensive and a symbol of power and wealth.

many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.	3_1.2.2.1.	Many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. Demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.	con	The above claim seems dependent on specific ecosystems.	The definition of 'pest' is itself a normative description that privileges human activities; e.g. kangaroos are pests because they eat crops. To hunt and kill them thus serves our own purposes, not any 'natural order.'	If it is beneficial to kill pests, then we can do that without needing to eat their meat.	Humans, as apex predators who have usurped the predatory apexes of the other predators in the ecosystems we have come to also inhabit, have an ethical responsibility to keep those ecosystems in check so that, eg, rampant deer populations do not cause deforestation and subsequent ecosystem collapse.  Even where there are populations of healthy apex predators, these populations should also be checked so they do not cause problems and kill people- and it would be unethical to waste that meat.	The majority of meat consumption is from cows, pigs, chickens, lamb, turkeys, not deer or kangaroo.	Insects are numerous and contribute to vegetable crop destruction. Humans could have a large impact on the adverse effects of insects by eating them.	The morality of hunting is irrelevant to whether farming is bad for the environment.	The context of this argument \(this specific sub-point\) is directly related to farming, not hunting animals. Proposing an argument of benefits of hunting overpopulated animals is a misrepresentation of the argument.

Many approaches to farming plants leads to monocultural agriculture practices that have a harmful impact on the wider environment.	con	Industrial, monoculture based, factory farmed meat is indeed bad in many ways. However, it represents only one failed model of agriculture. [Permaculture based farming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13412-015-0254-8) with strategic rotational grazing programs, have been shown to create many positive and vital ecological outcomes as well as improved ethics. Meat production, done in this manner, provides a very real and powerful tool in battling climate change, erosion, pollination and habitat loss, loss of bio diversity, and lack of soil health.	The problem is not meat eating, but agriculture. Growing corn, soy and wheat is incredibly destructive to our environment, to the soil. Nature's only sustainable food supply is herbivores on grasslands. The herbivore stimulates grass. The grass sequesters carbon. The meat of the herbivore is nutrient dense. Human beings participated in this natural cycle for 2 million years before the industrial revolution.	Farming plants often has a similarly severe environmental impact. Humans no longer live in an agrarian culture where every family can farm for their own sustenance, so this ecological impact is a function of human civilization itself, not our choice of diet between plants and animals specifically.	Meat animals can convert byproducts and waste that are not valuable for food into something humans can eat.	Not if done responsibly and with a particular focus on agricultural sustainability. If real farmers can take back the market from big-farma and work cohesively and symbiotically this is a very plausible potential.	The increasing demand for vegetables is causing deforestation in places like South America and Africa[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_farming)	The vegetable products used to create "fake" meat protein are typically soy and wheat-based, contributing to the threat that exists due to agricultural monoculture.	Feeding the planet on a vegetarian diet alone involves a heavy reliance on industrial monocrop agriculture.  Monocultural farms are more harmful to the environment than polycultural farms that grow a mix of plants and animals in a way that mirrors the natural ecosystem.  Polycultural farms only achieve the necessary output levels when you include the animal calories.  In terms of net animal life death, these polycultural farms cause lower loss of animal life than industrial monocultures.	This argument is highly dependent on "how" we raise animals. Many of the arguments in this thread are based on one small understanding of one single model of farming \(monocultural based industrial farming\). But there are other, more ecologically and productive models of raising meat. If we stay on course, your argument holds up. But if we shift to more permaculture based models of farming it does not.	Animal agriculture contributes to an environmentally, socially and financially balanced agricultural system, with mixed feed and food crops, nutritionally diverse diets, reduced inputs and closed nutrient cycles, and a balance of operating risk from diversification.	These same monocultural practices are also used to produce food for animals, thus creating a double impact. Cutting one half of this double impact would still reduce its impact.	The recycling of animal manures is an essential part of growing crops. The removal of this sorce of natural fertilizer would have a detrimental effect economically and environmentally on crop production and it would leave us totally dependent on artificial fertilisers.

ceasing to eat meat would harm the economy.	3_1.3.	Ceasing to eat meat would harm the economy.	con	Breeding livestock is necessary for many people \(particularly farmers\) to survive. Stopping this will eliminate their foundation of life.	Intensive livestock farming is economically bad for small farmers.	Whether or not something is good for the economy does not impact whether it is morally acceptable.	Keynesian economic theory deals pretty well with large fluctuations in commodities.	Ceasing to produce meat would be extremely harmful to low-income countries.	If the externalities of meat were properly priced in, meat production would be far less economically efficient than the production of crops.	Systems-based agricultural models are often reliant on meat production, both as an ecological service and money maker. Ceasing meat production would limit those farmers from receiving both those benefits.	Animal agriculture is an important part of local food economies in cold climates where many crops are not available year-round.	If subsidies related to farming animals were removed, the demand for meat would decrease due to higher prices and lower supply; allowing for reduction in meat consumption without a very unpopular and difficult to regulate law.	In the short term, yes. In the long term not ceasing to waste land and continuing to emit massive amounts of unnecessary greenhouse gasses will incur devastating economic consequences.  Beyond this, optimizing the use of water and ending subsidies for animal agriculture would encourage inevitable growth in other sectors, something which companies like Best Foods have been [compelled to accept](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-hellmanns-vegan-mayonnaise-20160202-story.html) and are now making vegan mayonnaise after losing their lawsuit over eggless Just Mayo.	Living beings should not be treated as commodities. It would be considered to be dehumanizing if applied to humans, and I believe similar emotional disconnection and distancing even from animals is a bad idea which leads to undesirable results \(abuses, desensitization to all harm including that done to humans, etc.\).	The economic impact may be manageable - it would not be the first time an industry has wound down, or been shut down or suppressed.	Meat keeps food prices high \(due to supply and demand\). With meat taking resources, such as land and water, the food supply is limited for consumers, which pushes the prices higher for food. [This is good for the economy because if food prices go too low, farmers run into difficulties covering their costs.](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/micro_price-floor.php)	Meat raises food prices for consumers. Livestock eat grains, which drives up demand for them.	Many people across the world depend on meat as part of their diet, and ending meat eating would lower food security/diversity for the majority of people.	Most of what we consume and buy today comes from animal production. It's not only about meat, it also concerns eggs, feathers, leather, but also candy. Stopping the production of meat will impact much more than the "Meat industry", and have a huge impact on global economy	Ceasing to eat meat would increase the economy. Exporting the grains fed to livestock in the US would increase the trade balance by $80 billion. [news.cornell.edu](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat)	This is an advantage as financial pressure is a force for change.	Global meat production is constantly [rising](http://www.worldwatch.org/global-meat-production-and-consumption-continue-rise-1). Worldwide meat production has tripled over the last four decades and increased 20% in just the last 10 years. This causes more jobs as the industry expands.	Slavery was the backbone of the economy in the past. Slavery was defended by economic interests throughout the life of human civilization until the time of the Industrial Revolution. From today's point of view, advocating slavery with economic interests seems absurd, and it can also be associated with the enslavement of other creatures.	Restricting or replacing meat leads to projects that, with the help of state-of-the-art sciences, create [innovative solutions](http://web.unep.org/championsofearth/laureates/2018/impossible-foods-and-beyond-meat) that [drive society](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/tackling-worlds-most-urgent-problem-meat) in many ways \(economic, moral, environmental, health, jobs, technology etc.\).	According to a study, less meat would come with [economic benefits](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/15/4146.abstract) due to lower [healthcare costs](https://web.archive.org/web/20080517050751/http://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02/) and fewer lost workdays associated with deaths from specific diseases caused by poor diet, adding up to an impressive savings of between $700 and $1,000 billion annually.

Of the 880 million rural poor people living on less than $1 per day, 70% are partially or completely [dependent](http://www.worldwatch.org/global-meat-production-and-consumption-continue-rise-1) on livestock for their livelihoods.	Not eating meat means not farming animals, not farming animals means no money to feed them, no money to feed them means no more cattle, chicken, pigs, etc. as long as we live in a capitalist system/economy.

something that is not morally acceptable for one person may be morally acceptable for another. suggesting that eating meat is morally unacceptable completely negates human history and the fact that, at one point, we needed to sustain off of it. however, this is not to say that there aren't more humane ways to treat cattle / livestock.	3_1.3.3.3.

Immoral things, or things now considered to be immoral, were once widely accepted in the past \(e.g. slavery\). This does not "negate history". Therefore, it is plausible that eating meat will come to be considered immoral \(by more people, and perhaps society in general\) in the future.

Farmers in low-income countries are typically poor, and would not have the resources to transition to a different occupation or type of farming if they were no longer able to buy livestock.

Insofar as stopping meat production helps alleviate climate change, it is beneficial for the economies of low-income countries.	Low-income countries suffer from malnutrition and food shortages. Since ceasing to eat meat would allow us to produce more food, this would benefit low-income countries.	A lot of food produced in poorer countries is for the consumption of livestock which is then imported as meat to the west. This food could be be used to directly feed people in low income countries.	The farming of animals for meat can be problematic.  For example, when the practice involves using land to produce food for animals at the expense of food for people.  However, I stayed in poor villages in Indonesia where pigs and chickens were fed scraps or scratched for grubs.  Those chickens and pigs did not take any food that was otherwise edible for people and I felt OK to eat the meat they produced.	Countless small farmers make a living from raising chickens, goats and other animals for meat.  If artificial meat supplants that industry it will be just more wealth accumulating to the corporate techie elite.

The idea of the possibility of constant growth is wrong. It is not possible to constantly grow the meat industry, because we live on a limited planet.

eating meat is a central part of human nature, evolution, and physiology/biology and thus its consumption is inherent to humankind.	3_1.4.	Eating meat is a central part of human nature, evolution, and physiology/biology and thus its consumption is inherent to humankind.	con	Buying and consuming processed meat from intensive livestock farming is anything but natural.	[Eating](https://askentomologists.com/2015/02/11/journey-through-time/) insects is equally part of human nature but was abandoned by some parts of humanity.	Just like other conceptions of what is natural, the idea of eating meat as being natural is socially constructed and subject to change.	There is no reason to assume that a natural lifestyle is essential \(healthwise or morally\), as there are plenty of reasons for humans to follow an "unnatural" lifestyle.	Meat has historically been both valuable for our technological progression, and necessary to continued human existence, it is not clear that that value has ended.	Moving from the consumption of meat in totality would signal a move from prioritizing our biological predispositions, as highly adapted persistence hunters, towards an emphasis on valuation of all life without regard for the occupied stratum of consciousness of the consumed. This is contradictory because of the difficulty in the determination of self-awareness of many types and complexities of life-forms, plants included, thus creating a difficulty in the determination of an objective boundary.	As almost everyone who discusses "human nature" only includes what they prefer not to be debated in this concept, the "human nature" argument is not objective, and there is no evidence to suggest there is a "human nature".	Just because something comes naturally to humans, it does not mean it is the correct decision to do it.	If societal instability becomes the norm and we have lost the traditions and knowledge on animal husbandry and meat preservation it will result in mass casualties within the human family.	Being that we're classified as omnivores, consuming meat would best be described as functional and significant, but not "central" to our existence.	There are many other things which could be argued to be "a central part of human nature and biology and thus inherent to humankind" which we do not \(continue to\) do.	Arguing that eating meat is human nature and inherent to humanity is the "appeal to nature" fallacy. [yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature)	The brain's circuits are designed to generate behaviour that is appropriate to our survival. Generally, beings find things tasty that their system needs, as the brain tells them [unconsciously](https://books.google.de/books?id=nkPj3dNFYwoC&redir_esc=y). Thus we can conclude: meat tastes good because it is useful.	The [consumption](http://www.livescience.com/24875-meat-human-brain.html) of \(cooked\) meat was crucial for the development of the human brain. Therefore you can state that eating meat is what made humans what they are today.	Humans have not evolved to hunt, eat or digest meat very successfully.	Low retention rates among vegetarians could be an indication that the majority of people cannot consistently abstain from eating meat. If the larger number of humans are unable to abstain from eating meat than asking them to would contradict the categorical imperative. If this contradiction does exist than it can not be unethical, or "wrong" to eat meat. [skeptoid.com/lapsed-vegetarians-or-return-of-the-meat-eaters/](http://skeptoid.com/blog/2011/10/16/lapsed-vegetarians-or-return-of-the-meat-eaters/)	Human life is unsustainable in many regions of the world without consuming meat. Without agricultural capitalism, humans can only survive without meat in warm climates with bountiful fruits and vegetables to gather.	If eating meat is wrong, then 78.2% of Humanity [\(which is the 100% of human population minus the estimated 21.8 of vegetarians\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country#Demographics) i.e. 5.4 billion people are wrong.

Animals on farms are routinely [mutilated with no anesthetic.](http://freefromharm.org/animal-products-and-ethics/a-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-humane-farming-myth/) The animals are castrated, given nose rings and ear tags, dehorned and debeaked, all of which are painful exercises carried out on most farms.	While this claim is true, it is not an argument for eating meat, but an argument against use of all forms of animal products.	This is not a necessary condition of dairy and egg farming. It is possible to treat cows and chickens humanely, and many farms do so. Consumers who seek out products prepared in this way, or who even raise their own cows or chickens, do not contribute to this maltreatment.

Conversely, keeping animals for non-meat products while treating them humanely and well would allow them to enjoy their full natural lives while producing useful products.	Unfortunately, Dairy Cows only produce milk once pregnant \(and shortly thereafter\). If a calf is male, it is often \(even on small farms\) killed, as it is more expensive to raise it. Or, it is sold to veal farming, which is inherently cruel \(I can explain further if needed\). If a calf is female, it's stolen away from the mother and not allowed to drink any of the milk, because the milk must be sold for money for humans. This process, even without overt visible cruelty, is very, very cruel.

Being technologically advanced so we can hunt is not the same as saying we are good hunters.

Using our intellect as humans we could easily bypass our so called "need" for meat. Also, being hard to determine is not the same thing as being contradictory.	There is no "objective boundary" between good and evil. All boundaries are subjective and are yet no less compulsory as such. To assume that we need an objective boundary to make ethical decisions problematizes ethics into circuity.

'What is' is a better indicator than philosophical thoughts on 'what ought to be' because it has shown its applicability.	con	Every progressive change throughout history involved people collectively taking action to change "what is" in favor of their view of "what ought to be". So if we look at "what is", we discover that it *is* the case that there exists an extensive proven track record of successful cases where "what ought to be" has led to positive cultural change that we value today. So by this point's own reasoning, we should therefore take "what ought to be" seriously.

No. A bully beating up a weaker kid to feel powerful is acting according to human nature too. Gorging on high-calorie food is acting according to human nature. Human nature is sometimes good, sometimes evil. Morality must be sensitive to human nature, true. But the entire reason we need morality as a subject of study is that *sound* moral reasoning doesn't come naturally to us.

as animals lack rights, it is morally permissible to raise them for slaughter.	3_1.5.	As animals lack rights, it is morally permissible to raise them for slaughter.	con	Animals are unable to conceptualise of morality therefore they do not deserve to exist within our moral community.	The fact that humans have developed to a greater extent than animals means that they should have the ability to use animals for their own ends.	Humans should not have the authority to make decisions about animals given we do not have perfect information about their experiences.	Unlike wild animals, farmed animals are born explicitly due to human action. While we may have a duty to ensure that their lives are not unnecessarily cruel, it is not immoral to kill them for our own ends given they would not have existed otherwise.	Animals should have rights because they are sentient beings.	Eating meat violates animals' right to life.	Animals do in fact have rights. Many forms of cruelty are explicitly outlawed. One cannot, for instance, torture a dog for years in their basement. Therefore the statement that animals do not have rights is fundamentally false.	Rights by their nature correspond to duties. Since the actions of animals lack moral content they can't be said to have duties; we don't talk about a tiger or a cow being morally good or bad, or assign moral obligations to them, because by their nature they are not rational beings.	Animals not having rights doesn't imply in any way that killing and torturing them for our consumption is moral.	Animals lack free will.	There is no trait that makes animals different than humans that if the same logic were applied to a human, it would justify farming that human as meat.	Animals are only given rights by us. If we were, as a society, to say that animals don’t have rights then they wouldn’t have rights. Ethics aren’t inherent for beings that aren’t capable of complex thought. A dog is only able to understand that the rumble in their stomach means they’re hungry — they can’t contemplate whether or not they truly exist or what it means to know something.	Rights are socially constructed by fallible and limited humans. Animals not having enforced 'rights' does not mean that it is okay to do anything to animals, only that the humans in a position of power creating rights did not think it worthwhile to give them rights.	From a utilitarian metric, life itself has no value, but rather the emotions experienced in life is what matters. The way we harvest animals is considerably less painful than how a vast majority of animals will die naturally — such as being slowly torn apart by their predators.	Historically, there have been times when certain categories of humans did not ‘have rights.’ Many of those rights were denied due to a supposed ‘inferiority’ to groups in power, who possessed ‘rights.’ In some cases, those humans were born explicitly for exploitation. We now regognize how wrong those policies are and have been working past the problematic moral dilemmas and inequities these policies caused. It’s a moral imperative that we do the same with other species.	Rights are inalienable and "endowed by our creator". They are not given just by law which why it is morally defensible to challenge laws that attempt to deny rights. Even though current law does not give rights to animals, it does not mean that animals do not have them under the principles through which the concept of rights was created.	In most religions, animals lack souls/spirits, putting them decisively into a different moral category than humans, permitting a different set of ethics.	Animals don't lack rights, and even if they did, they shouldn't. We should consider cruelty to animals immoral for the same reason we consider cruelty to humans immoral. It is an affront to the empathy we share with living beings.
animals are unable to conceptualise of morality therefore they do not deserve to exist within our moral community.	3_1.5.1.	Animals are unable to conceptualise of morality therefore they do not deserve to exist within our moral community.	con	Animals do not offer rights to one another. Animals hurt and eat one another.	All and only human beings have the [capacity to reason](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/regan01.htm). This is a definite feature of moral judgement. As animals lack this ability they are not morally equivalent.	Animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights.	By this logic babies, little children as well as severely mentally disabled people cannot be possessors of rights either. But that would be wrong.	Nonhuman animals are unable to engage in sophisticated moral reasoning. Therefore, nonhuman animals cannot be held to sophisticated moral standards. Humans on the other hand can engage in sophisticated moral reasoning. Therefore, humans can be held to sophisticated moral standards. This includes standards about how we should or should not behave towards nonhuman animals.	Animals can conceptualize morals. Dogs and monkeys, for example, have a concept of fairness. Experiments have been done where two monkeys \(or dogs\) are given different treats for the same trick and those receiving the lesser treat for the same work will become agitated, angry or refuse the treat, even though one bad treat should be better than none.	Animals act on instinct and cannot deliberate between actions, therefore they have no moral status. For example, a tiger cannot be made to stand at court for killing a man, neither can a dog. If they can have no regard for human, we cannot have any regard for them. Therefore we can kill animals for food.	Humans don't have a moral responsibility to those who they don't think would exhibit the same moral responsibility were they in the same position. You have moral responsibility to a child because they will one day be an adult and you can reasonably expect them to treat you morally. I do not expect cows to have morals besides not being pointlessly sadistic. They would eat me if they could and were hungry, so I feel no qualms about eating them.	You are not required to be a moral subject in order to become a moral object. Utilitarism, for instance, is not based on the ability to conceptualise right or wrong but by the ability to feel pain or pleasure.

It is immoral to bring creatures into existence in order to use and kill them. For example, it would be immoral to give birth to new children and use them as slaves or food.	If we cease eating meat then millions of animals will never be born at all. We cannot be certain that animals would prefer to never be born than to die prematurely.

At the very least, it reduces the quality of their lives.	As discussed earlier, these animals are bred specifically for human consumption. If humans had not created these animals, they could not possibly "be eaten by other predators/scavengers in the wild."	"Unbalanced in value" is dubious. By what objective measure of value are you using? You are basing the value of a life on their potential to achieve some human-centric measure of worth. A feral human left in the wild, or a mentally handicapped child, is of equal value to a penned sheep then.	Who is to argue when anthropomorphising is or isn't wrong? Blacks were enslaved because they were just brutes. Then one day we anthropomorphised them. Voila, suddenly rights are bestowed.	Animals in the wild have freedom of movement and other increased choices not available to farm animals. Quality of life is not decided purely by length or absence of suffering, or how its end is met.	For this statement to be true every animal which is prey would end their lives at the hands of a predator. In fact most survive to experience a natural cause of death.	Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to animals. There is no such attribution in the claim.

Comparing the two, this makes pleasure more valuable to humans than animal lives.	Billions of animals are brutalized and tortured on factory farms every year. Since the only pleasure humans get from eating meat is gustatory pleasure, it is doubtful that the pain and suffering that these animals experience can ever be justified according to utilitarian principles.	It is not necessarily true that human pleasure is scarce. People find many ways to experience pleasure, through spending time with loved ones, participating in hobbies and watching media entertainment. There are likely also other foods humans can eat to experience pleasure without relying on meat.	Human pleasure evaporates quickly while an animal life is lost forever.

For any supposed capacity that humans possess and animals lack, and in virtue of which humans but not animals are taken to have rights, some humans will lack that capacity and some animals may possess that capacity. For instance, humans generally have the ability to reason, while most animals lack this capacity. But this cannot be the basis on which humans have and animals lack rights, because certain humans, including young infants, lack the ability to reason and certain animals may have it.

Thus, there is a difference in the logic applied.	As noted in the linked article, plants are able to survive losing a large portion of their biomass - and many produce fruiting bodies deliberately intended for consumption by animals - whereas harvesting an animal for meat kills it 100% of the time. It is more possible to ethically harvest \(some\) plants than animals.	Farming animals for meat requires either farming plants for their food, or allowing them to graze in deliberately altered semi-natural environments. Therefore, farming meat produces a greater utilitarian loss than farming plants, as farming plants only harms and kills plants directly, while farming meat harms and kills both plants and the animals.

The claim that animals are not rational beings is debated. This book gives an overview of the different studies on animal rationality and interpretations of the term rationality [philpapers.org](https://philpapers.org/rec/HURRA). Since it is not clear that animals are not rational beings, you cannot just assume their actions lack moral content. And even if their actions lacked moral content to them, this might not be the case for us, as human beings interpreting their behaviour.	Humans should not predate other species for the sake of it, only as and when it's out of necessity.	No one argued the moral onus to not eat meat was on the animals. We as humans have rights and therefore duties.	The claim that animals don't have rights, because rights equate with duty is an outdated one made by Kant, Descartes, and others. We now have greater insight- and more questions- about animal intelligence and the nature of consciousness in general, so can no longer hold these claims as valid arguments.	People should treat things \(other humans, animals, plants, or minerals\) according to their natures. It is natural for a prey animal to be eaten, and so there is nothing immoral in eating it.	Rights correspond to duties that moral agents have towards the holder of rights, not necessarily duties that the holder of rights has.	Rights are based on the ability to suffer, not on the ability to think rationally.	By this logic we should be able to eat severely mentally disabled people or the insane, since many of them are incapable of acting with moral content \(which is why they often can not be held criminally liable for their actions\). Clearly that would be immoral. For the same reasons, this argument is flawed.	The rights of animals can correspond to the duties of humans, but not to duties of other animals.

Morality is not predicated upon the nature of or actions of others.	Humans treat all sorts of things unnaturally: for example, using animal products to create glue, or minerals to create computers. Clearly humans have the capacity to go beyond a thing's "natural purpose."	All life suffers, and all life dies. Furthermore, all life inevitably results in the suffering and death of other life. Competition for food and habitat, predation, competition to reproduce...all of this happens even without human influence, even in microbial ecosystems. So the logical conclusion of this claim is that life itself is cruel and immoral. It is a spiritual, subjective, and therefore unsubstantiated claim. One cannot possibly know the truth.	When most humans see slaughter houses, they feel [discomfort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOBWoAwCQyk&has_verified=1) whereas if a carnivore animal saw one they'd feel hunger and likely attempt to eat the animal there and then. Therefore it can no longer be considered our nature to treat animals as prey or act as if we are instinctually predators.

Modern medicine would rather put an egg on his face. Any claim that certain knowledge is impossible to possess is one which should be viewed with scepticism, as there is no knowledge which is arbitrarily and absolutely incomprehensible.	Suffering is unpleasant, and all sufficiently conscious animals attempt to avoid it. \(Even less conscious animals reflexively avoid pain!\) This suggests it is something we should not deliberately inflict, and take reasonable steps to avoid inflicting in others, as well as avoiding ourselves. Even if we cannot perfect the world, we should attempt to improve it.	If life only produced suffering and negative experiences, this argument may hold water. However, life also produces joy and pleasure and enjoyable experiences. As such, according to [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) and similar ethical theories, our "job" or at least the most moral courses of action are to minimize suffering while maximizing pleasure and pleasant experiences.	This claim is invoking moral skepticism - there is no objective basis for wrong and right. Holding this position is extremely impractical as it permits all human behaviour and it follows that actions such as murder and rape- both observable in non-human life- are acceptable. In reality, this is not the case. Human behaviour is governed by norms whose content is subjective but whose existence  is not. Subjective though it may be, we accept that there are principles of right and wrong.

As a human, we know that we make choices and we also see each other making choices. Animals, by contrast, mostly seem to be biotic machines, always trying to get the components they need to run, and spread.	Many animals have demonstrated free will through play, associations and affections with humans and other animals, and more. Anyone who has owned a cat can attest that animals demonstrate free will; dolphins and primates also frequently exhibit it.	Because something lacks 'free will', does not mean it is incapable of suffering.	Without evidence, it could just as easily be stated that humans also lack free will, leaving all factors equal on this standpoint.	Assuming humans have free will, there's just as much reason to believe some animals do as well. Many of them have highly complex minds and problem-solving ability, crows being a good example. Contrary to popular belief, pigs are also highly intelligent.	Speciesism is the ideology that one species is 'better than' another simply because they view their species specific abilities as inherently more valueable than that of another species. Many humans view cognition as the valuable human attribute that raises the value of our species above that of other animals, however, each animal contributes to the health and well-being of the planet in their own unique way, and it is impossible to categorize one characteristic as more valuable than the next.	There is no "moral" way to kill an innocent animal who thinks, feels and wants to live — just like humans do.

From a utilitarian metric, life itself has no value, but rather the emotions experienced in life is what matters. The way we harvest animals is considerably less painful than how a vast majority of animals will die naturally — such as being slowly torn apart by their predators.	con	Keeping animals for slaughtering is a lot more humane then letting them die through natural ways such as predation, starvation or disease.	It is not just how an animal dies that matters, but how it lives. A free life, even one with a \(temporarily\) painful end, is arguably preferable to a life in a cage, especially when some of the more barbaric and cruel factory farming practices \(de-beaking, other forms of un-anaesthetized mutilation, insufficient health care to prevent diseases from spreading across the herd, etc.\) come into play.	The consumption of prey animals by humans is significantly more humane in comparison to how these creatures are hunted and ripped apart in the wild by their natural predators. Refusing to eat meat does NOT prevent brutal, bloody or painful animal death.  Human consumption of meat in fact reduces that pain and suffering by ensuring the creatures are clean, healthy and unspoiled before being humanely killed for later consumption.	Beeing kept in narrow spaces and very likely has a negative utilitarian value. The utilitarian value of nonexistence is neutral. Since the animals we eat exist specifically for this purpose, not eating meat would lead to a neutral utilitarian value instead of a negative value.	Life has a high amount of value in utilitarian terms because prematurely dying means not being able to experience the positive emotions you would otherwise. The prematurely short lives of animals raised just to maturity for meat is probably a larger utility loss than how they end up dying.	Utilitarianism is not the most valid measure of moral value. Often, principles such as "killing is wrong" are considered to be a moral law despite the fact that this may lead to higher level of happiness.

Eating animals that have been raised in a responsible environment and killed humanely offers a better life than most ever obtain from living wild.	Healthy farm animals fit into a healthy farm system like wild animals fit into a wild ecosystem. In domesticating live stock we have created animals that are most comfortable in agricultural \(rather than wild\) conditions.	It is not just that humans keep animals for slaughtering, but that they produce animals for the specific purpose of slaughtering and eating them. Without the meat industry, these animals would not need to be bred in such numbers and less animals would be killed.	While we should aim to reduce and eventually eliminate the suffering of animals, vegetarianism is a tacit demand for the extinction of all domesticated animals used for food. If an animal living in the wild were given the choice of being guaranteed food, shelter, and procreation knowing that their eventual demise would be painless and provide their ancestors a similar lifestyle, they would likely agree to live under those conditions rather than suffer in the wild.	If we did not raise animals for meat, those farm animals would not exist in the wild; rather, they would simply not exist.	We are not morally culpable for the deaths of animals in the wild. By contrast, we are morally culpable for suffering we deliberately inflict.	Not keeping an animal at all is therefore even "more humane" compared to both of these options. We should therefore, as intelligent beings, choose the best option possible and not keep animals at all, since we don`t need to do so.

That animals eat other animals is the natural order of the world; to replicate and continue this is not immoral.	con	Just like other animals, it is simply part of the food chain for us to eat meat.	Morality is best described as an ideal way "to be." This coincides with natural law. The most basic natural law seems to be that a system must adapt to subjugate other less-adapted systems \(eat or be eaten\). All moral systems are subservient to this basic universal morality. Thinking we may or should transcend that construct, when we are, ourselves, products of it, reeks of hubris.	Every organism on earth dies or is killed at some point, so other organisms can live. This is how nature works.	Keeping animals for slaughtering is a lot more humane then letting them die through natural ways such as predation, starvation or disease.	People should treat things \(other humans, animals, plants, or minerals\) according to their natures. It is natural for a prey animal to be eaten, and so there is nothing immoral in eating it.	As humans are animals the logical extension of this is that humans should be allowed to kill each other without consequences. Clearly we have progressed beyond such fatalism.	Humans, as the dominant species on Earth, have transcended the natural order in countless ways. We are no longer required to kill to survive and so have no excuse for not taking on higher moral obligations.	There is nothing natural about factory farming and caging, controlling, and herding "prey" animals on a day to day basis. This cannot be argued to be treating said "prey" animals "according to their natures".	Many natural things, like murder, rape, or leaving offspring to die are deeply immoral. The consumption of meat is immoral on similar grounds.	If we are concerned about the death and harm of animals the logical extension of this care is to do as much as possible to prevent animals from dying in the wild. That we don't do so supports the idea we accept that this natural dynamic of predator-prey is not always overridden by animal welfare concerns.	It may be natural for reflectively rational creatures like humans to become aware of the consequences of their actions and to abstain from doing things like eating meat.	Humankind has exceeded 8 billion individuals in size. this achievement was possible due to unnatural mechanisms. Humankind has not followed the natural order \(at least\) since the industrial revolution. The concept of morality today is different from the concept of morality in pre-historic times.	If predation is the natural order of the world, then humans should actually predate rather than blindly consuming meat from sources they are not familiar with. Humans desiring to eat meat should go into the wild, kill the wild animal, and then consume it. However, many people are more comfortable with blindly consuming animals whose death they do not have to consider — this is not the 'natural order' at all.	Equating "natural" and "not immoral" clearly could be used to justify any activity and status quo, and is a fallacy. Eating meat must be judged not simply on whether it is "natural", but whether it is necessary \(in todays advanced society\), and in the context \(e.g. what is best for humans? for society? for the animals?\)	It may not be immoral to eat other animals, but the fact that having to grow animals to satisfy this need creates environmental issues may make it immoral.	If domesticated animals are raised ethically in a way as to have reasonable lives, then they are allowed to exist and experience life, where in a world without meat farming they probably would not.	This isn't just an issue about morality or natural order. This is also an issue about resources, raising animals, fishing and a lot of other related activities consume lots of resources. Population is growing and with the population, the needs of humanity as a whole. The massive amounts of resources needed for meat mass consuption in todays format is an ineficient and irresponsable use of the resources of the planet, which will unavoidibly affect humanity itself as well as the whole planet.	Nature is much more cruel in the way of animal on animal violence. When humans kill most animals for food it is done in a fast and humane way.	Lots of animals are herbivores, and don't eat other animals. Eating animal is not more natural than eating plants.	If eating meat is morally wrong and we are obligated to minimize the meat humans eat, we are also morally obligated to minimize the meat other animals eat.

For humans, as for these animals, it is therefore only natural.	Animals sometimes die out when a new predator interrupts a natural balance. Thus hunting animals to extinction is a natural process.	This argument implies the necessity of killing for survival. Humans do not depend on killing and eating animals for their survival, and certainly not through the mass-breeding of animals with the sole purpose of killing them.	There is no reason to assume that a natural lifestyle is essential \(healthwise or morally\), as there are plenty of reasons for humans to follow an "unnatural" lifestyle.	All living beings kill — either plant life or animal life — to survive. Even as a vegetarian, you're supporting the deaths of animals that lose habitat to farming, are killed for pest control, etc. The question isn't whether or not to kill--it's how to do so humanely.	It is natural for organisms to die so others can live. It is not natural for these organisms to be exploited, mass produced and fed growth hormones.	Nature is amoral. Humans are not.	If one day, humans disappear from earth, prey animals will be still eaten by other predators. Nature set up a system where some animals eat others. Humans are not a different creature, we only has a different weapon \(intelligence\) than other predators. Humans have no influence on nature's law; it is a system that was here long ago before humans even existed on this earth.	If we didn't eat animals, their equivalents in the wilds would still be eaten by other predators, so as long as we give our animals living conditions and deaths that aren't worse/less humane than ones in the wild, eating them makes no difference, morally speaking. Therefore, we should instead focus on improving the living conditions of animals and making their deaths as humane as possible. This is a far more realistic goal to focus on, compared to trying to prevent humanity from consuming meat.	This argument negates all contributions made by medicine.	Nature is quite specific about which animals routinely kill and eat others and which do not. A human without technology or fire would largely be unable to kill, butcher or eat anything other than perhaps a few bugs with their physical equipment. They lack sharp teeth and claws for ripping flesh and/or catching prey and a low enough stomach pH for safely digesting raw meat. Just like the other great apes, humans are physically adapted to consuming a predominantly plant based diet after weaning.

Even as a vegetarian, you're supporting the deaths of animals that lose habitat to farming, are killed for pest control, etc. The question isn't whether or not to kill--it's how to do so humanely.	con	Plants tend not to need to kill to survive.	Scavengers eat dead or decaying things they find, but don't kill them.	Some living beings survive off mineral deposits.	This is true but the killing ,and more importantly, the growing and raising of live stock is not done humanely.	As a vegetarian, one strives to reduce suffering. It is impossible to eliminate it. And there is a difference between supporting the deaths of animals and unintentionally causing them.	Give an animal a good life, and you cannot humanely kill it since it does not want to die. The only way to kill an animal humanely is to do it when it is living a life of pain, but if you are intentionally adding pain in the first place then you've already lost the opportunity to be humane.

As a species, humans can naturally evolve, in time, from omnivore to herbivore. Many humans eat only plant-based foods without any health repercussions and so it is possible.

if we are concerned about the death and harm of animals the logical extension of this care is to do as much as possible to prevent animals from dying in the wild. that we don't do so supports the idea we accept that this natural dynamic of predator-prey is not always overridden by animal welfare concerns.	3_1.7.10.	If we are concerned about the death and harm of animals the logical extension of this care is to do as much as possible to prevent animals from dying in the wild. That we don't do so supports the idea we accept that this natural dynamic of predator-prey is not always overridden by animal welfare concerns.	con	Most people intuitively make a sharp distinction between the deaths of animals in the wild and the deaths of animals in farms, which suggests that they do not treat farms as simply another instance of the predator-prey dynamic.	That we ought to eliminate both the suffering of wild animals and the suffering of farm animals is a natural consequence of the idea that animals are morally important. It is not a conclusion that we should avoid.	It is [plausible to believe](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/) that most natural habitats are, on net, bad for animal wellbeing. If we cared overridingly about animal welfare, then we ought to destroy those habitats. The fact that we reject this indicates that animal welfare is not the overriding consideration, and that there is intrinsic value associated with the operation of natural habitats.	Humans are concerned about being responsible for the death of animals, so the question "Is eating meat wrong?" is about humans eating meat and being responsible for the caused harm, and not about non-human animals eating meat.	There is some concern for the [welfare of animals in the wild](http://www.animal-ethics.org/wild-animal-suffering-section/wild-animal-suffering-matters/), although the movement is probably not as large as it should be.	Humans have made improvements to nonhuman animals' habitats for welfare reasons. Examples of this are the [provision of water](https://www.thedodo.com/water-man-kenya-animals-2263728686.html) during droughts to prevent dehydration related suffering and deaths and the [construction of crossings](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/03/animal-wildlife-crossings/) over or under busy roads to prevent accident related injuries and deaths. The planting of biome-appropriate, food-producing plants to alleviate hunger might also be considered.	If the suffering of the eaten animal is what makes eating meat immoral, humans have as much right to meat or lack thereof than other meat-eating animals. Creating a world without animal consumption would make entire ecosystems dependent on the human existence and good will.	"Extreme forms of suffering like starvation, dehydration, or being eaten alive by a predator are much more common in wild animals than farm animals. Crocodiles and hyenas disembowel their prey before killing them \(Tomasik 2009\).

farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.	3_1.8.1.	Farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.	con	Millions of animals are [killed](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97836&page=1) every year to allow for appropriate land to grow crops such as wheat and barley.	A [study](http://freefromharm.org/common-justifications-for-eating-animals/comparing-animal-deaths-production-plant-animal-foods/) done on how many animals die to produce 1,000,000 calories of a number of different food sources found that for vegetables it is only 2.55 animals, while for beef it is 29 animals and for chicken it is 251.1. This suggests significantly fewer animals are harmed in the production of vegetarian products.	Converting land to make it suitable for harvesting soybeans and other vegetable products results in [habitat loss](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/impacts/habitat_loss/) that threatens entire ecosystems.	Since animals hurt by vegetarian farming are hurt as an unintended consequence, while producing meat necessarily involves killing animals, the former is moral and the latter is not.	The dairy and egg industries cause extreme animal maltreatment that is arguably on a par with the meat and fishing industries.	Killing pests - not just insects but large, intelligent animals - is a necessity on farms of any kind.	Land must be cleared both for farming crops and rearing livestock, so the cumulative damage done by vegetarian farming is still lower.	When we eat vegetables we are taking away food that animals could possibly eat. This could harm them in the long run.	Over time indirect animal deaths from farming could be reduced, if this was an explicit goal.	The argument is an example of [Whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) aka [Tu quoque logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque), and therefore does not directly refute the argument that eating meat is wrong.	Food production for humans will always directly or indirectly disturb the ecosystem of other animals. If we take that as a given then we have to ask ourselves what types of harm to animals and the broader ecosystem are acceptable tradeoffs when producing food.	Raising farm animals ultimately kills more plants than raising plant foods, due to the amount of feed required to raise the animals.	Insects are not what many people would consider "sentient animals", although they technically are. "Minimizing" the harm to a smaller volume of animals, or to animals from a specific phylum is sort of splitting hairs.	Most farmed animals live miserable lives on factory farms, which is arguably a more important consideration than the number of animals killed.

Small animals have far less sophisticated consciousness than most farm animals, so it is less morally wrong to kill them.	con	This logic leads then to the proposal that we eat more chicken and less beef, or that we eat more mice instead of chicken or beef. But there is no way to calculate the level of consciousness of a chicken compared to a cow and then multiply that by the number of chickens needed to replace the meat in one cow.	This is not certain. Elephants are far larger than humans, but also widely acknowledged to be less intelligent, even if more intelligent than "average" animals. Without first-hand insight into the thoughts and consciousness of any given animal, all we have is guesswork from observed behaviour.

When we eat vegetables we are taking away food that animals could possibly eat.

Nature itself has a way of regulating wild life population. In the long run the population of for example cows will decrease, ensuring enough food.	Our produce is overwhelmingly grown in farms, not harvested, and thus not taken out of nature and away from animals. If you meant that any fruit that's eaten by a human was stolen from animals because it could have theoretically been gifted to an animal, than you'd have to consider eating anything stealing from every other animal on Earth, including humans.	Generally feeding animals farm-grown produce is thought to have harmful affects on both the animal and human populations of a region when we could allow nature to self-regulate its populations. Animal feeding could potentially be used to lessen the immediate impact of widespread deforestation on some species, but generally this would be drastically less efficient than choosing not to destroy their habitats in the first place and would only slow the local animal population's imminent demise.

Animals evidently do have goals and preferences, or there would be absolutely nothing to drive them to action.	Animals act by impulse and not by will. It is automatic. Therefore they do not choose their actions. They only do actions.	[Animals display planning behaviour and anticipation/the ability to learn patterns](https://theconversation.com/clever-crows-can-plan-for-the-future-like-humans-do-80627), which is at the very least a precursor to having hopes and goals.	Animals can't be inferior to something they don't have. Only human beings are able to hypothesize their presence in time and space, hence acting freely and have a morality.

The limited sentience of most animal species means that they can be used to fulfill human desires, such as through farming, as long as it is not unnecessarily cruel.	con	All animals display the instinct to self-preservation, that is, the instinct to avoid pain or damage to their bodies.	We are not sure of this "limited sentience" and, in fact, the further into animal intelligence we dive, the more evidence we find that intelligence and self-awareness are far more widespread than we once thought. Some of the animals we consume as food are, in fact, quite intelligent - capable of problem solving, complex social relationships, even communicating in ways that border on language.

This indicates that rights exist independently of social construction.	This claim makes multiple statements. "Rights do not exist in the natural world" is true.

"human rights" are not laws of the universe but rather a practical tool humans use to govern interaction with each other. they are a means of outlining and governing acceptable behavior so that we may live peacefully with each other. we can do this because we can communicate with each other and hold each other accountable. we cannot communicate with other species and hold them accountable in the same way yet.  a wolf does not understand, and will not respect, a universal right to life.	3_1.8.4.9.

A wolf does not understand, and will not respect, a universal right to life.	con	This argument suggests that humans only have a right to life because a human society claims such. In other words, the right to life — for anything, is not an intrinsic value. Therefore, outside the confines of a society which grants \(which allows\) the right to life, humans do not have a right to life.	Stating that one's capacity to understand, communicate with others, and hold others accountable for their actions is not sufficient reason to argue that non-human animals should not also have a right to life. Babies and the elderly who've lost their capacity for reason are two examples of humans who do not have the capacity to understand, communicate with others, and hold others accountable for their actions. Yet, our society grants them the right to life.	Rights can be enforced on both humans and nonhuman animals, such as by imprisoning a murderer \(or predator\) that would infringe on others' right to life and safety.	We only experience human consciousness, but we don't know for sure whether animals are conscious or not. We do have some evidence suggesting that animals do have social systems which govern acceptable behaviour, communicate with each other, and hold each other accountable. We cannot discount their perspectives and values simply because we aren't able to understand them.

Even if animals did live free of human slaughter, they would most likely die due to consumption by predators anyways so you might as well use the animals in a way that benefits humans.	con	The way an animal lives is at least as important as how it dies, and farm animals have demonstrably lower quality of life than wild animals in at least some cases \(over-crowded cages/enclosures, absence of freedom of movement, inability to escape rivals, etc.\).	The argument that you should do something to your own benefit because the same thing would happen if you didn't so you might as well is immoral. For example, I might as well rape that passed out girl because it's going to happen to her anyway so I might as well get to do it is an immoral way to approach something.

Cows and chickens know what it is like to feel pain, and desire not to feel pain. This is sufficient to give them a right to live free of suffering.

Humans are part of the natural world. If morality is an irrelevant concept in the context of the natural world, it follows that morality must be irrelevant in the context of humans. But the author states that morality applies to humans. This is a contradiction, and therefore the claim taken as a whole is logically invalid.	We already apply moral concepts to non-human animals in most societies. Forms of animal cruelty are illegal in many countries, showing that we can intuitively and practically apply moral reasoning to non-human animals.	The philosophy of non-consumption of animals IS a human moral construct asserting itself onto human beings.  Vegetarianism isn't being applied to the animals. Animals are not being held to moral standards; we are.	Good morality and excercise of care is essential to keep both the human mind and the ecosystem in a healthy state, while ignorance will only lead to endless self inflicted suffering. Animals are not held under the same moral standards as human beings.	The problem with your argument is that many people don't actually contribute to society... Are we allowed then to experiment on them\(mentally handicapped, children...\)?	If being right means being beneficial to human species, then moral goodness is a merely “objective” property \(in principle measurable\) about the physical effects of something. But moral statements are not merely descriptive. People may disagree morally without disagreeing about any facts about the physical world and its laws.	If morality served only to allow people to live together and co-operate then all kinds of wrongs would be morally permissible. People can live together and co-operate in a society that allows slavery, forced child marriage, brutal excessive punishments or female genital mutilation, for example.	Morality is a subjective standard, and relative only to the standard which has been agreed is moral. "Right" and "wrong" cannot be debated objectively.

Ceasing to eat meat would mean that vast quantities of livestock would die without being replaced as they are unable to survive effectively outside of human agriculture.	con	Animals are meant to exist as part of a food chain. If we, the apex predators, simply stopped consuming meat thousands of species \(cows, sheep, pigs etc..\) would become extinct as they only exist due to their value as food, due to selective breeding. This would invariably destabilise countless ecosystems.	Even if there was a one-off slaughter of all of those livestock, it is still a preferable outcome from the perspective of animal welfare to prevent the enslavement of untold future generations of animals.	The quantity of animals that exist is less important than having each animal posses a good quality of life free of suffering.	Veganism is endangering animals. Diversity of all kinds is worth preserving. Without demand for animal products the majority of domesticated animal breeds would become extinct. Cows do not exist in the wild, they exist within the framework of supply and demand. Just because animal diversity was created by humans doesn't make it less valuable than natural diversity. Treat animals well within the supply and demand structure. Don't prevent them being born by removing the need for them.	Current farming practices prevent certain species from going extinct. Animals bred on farms have been selectively bred for centuries, resulting in genetically imprinted tendencies. Many widely farmed species are incapable of surviving in the wild. With many species being sustained solely to provide nutritional purpose, veganism would effectively disincentivise the further preservation of these species. Notably, cattle, chickens, and sheep come to mind.	The habitat, well being, and continued survival of a majority of domestic livestock is directly dependent upon human consumption of meat.	All farmed animals are artificially inseminated more times a year than it is natural. So left alone, farm animals will become half in number after the first generation dies.	All farm animals have natural predators, which means that, left in the wild, around a third of them will be eaten.	This claim implies that what effectively amounts to an unnatural overpopulation of farm animals is desirable.	It would be ethically permissible to allow these excess animals to live pleasant lives and die of old age without being replaced. The moral objective is not to maintain a certain quantity of farm animals, rather to maintain an acceptable quality of life for all animals wherever possible, and avoid actively wronging them.

consuming vegetables is also cruel to both the plants and to the workers responsible for the agricultural process.	3_1.8.12.

For the majority of the fruit- and vegetable-buying population, this is unavoidable, so therefore, eating meat is no more cruelty-free than eating vegetables: [www.pbs.org](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/labor-laws-left-farm-workers-behind-vulnerable-abuse), [www.ilo.org](http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Agriculture/lang--en/index.htm), [www.hrw.org](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/10/03/national-cashew-day-more-nuts), [www.pri.org](https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-06-25/farmworkers-push-back-against-machismo-and-abuse-california-s-wine-country)	If eating meat is immoral because animals feel pain, then eating plants may also be immoral. Scientists have been applying the strategies of animal behavior research to plants and finding that plants share many of the characteristics of animals - including an awareness of their environment, of injury \(pain\), memory \(non-genetic\), and the ability to communicate. If consuming beings that feel pain is immoral, and both plants and animals feel pain, where does that leave us?[\[1\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrrSAc-vjG4)[\[2\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-4w5xYLwiU)	Time is relative for each living thing. Plants/trees live for 100s of years, they just don't feel the same amount of pain as animals do because of their slow growth. However, you're still hurting them. For example, think of us as trees and mosquitoes as humans.	Increased farming to produce more plant foods will result in an increase in the amount human exploitation in countries where work regulations and workers rights are poor. Perhaps these concerns should be addressed first?	We don't eat other humans. Why? Because we're so similar to them, so we feel strong empathy. Animals share much of the same DNA, biology and even emotions as humans, so we feel strong empathy for them as well. Plants, however, are from a separate biological kingdom, and work very differently from both humans and animals. Although we do have to eat some organic food to survive, we can choose the source that causes the least suffering from our human perspective.	Workers can suffer in both plant and animal agriculture, so this not an argument for or against either of them.	Eating botanical fruit from plants is not damaging to the plant in any way, so it is not cruel. Some vegetables are actually, in the botanical sense, fruit. Conversely, eating root vegetables, for example, is damaging to the plant. But since plants are not biologically designed to feel pain, it is not cruel to eat them.	Assuming this was true, consuming meat indirectly consumes vast amounts of plants that are used as animal feed. Eating meat means indirectly contributing to the death of both plants and animals, not animals instead of plants.	Cruelty suggests suffering. As plants lack any sensory system, and by observation take longer to die, it is perhaps safer to assume that less suffering means less pain. As plants do not experience physical pain, such a claim is moot.

if eating meat is immoral because animals feel pain, then eating plants may also be immoral. scientists have been applying the strategies of animal behavior research to plants and finding that plants share many of the characteristics of animals - including an awareness of their environment, of injury \(pain\), memory \(non-genetic\), and the ability to communicate. if consuming beings that feel pain is immoral, and both plants and animals feel pain, where does that leave us?[\[1\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crrsac-vjg4)[\[2\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-4w5xylwiu)	3_1.8.12.2.

For scientific claims such as these, journalistic sources are simply insufficient, and scientific literature should be cited.	Plants do not have a brain, so do not have a consciousness	The amount of consciousness that a plant could potentially have is nothing in comparison to the amount of consciousness had by animals	Further in the future, it could be possible to transition to wholly synthetic food or other means of fuelling our bodies.	The feeling of pain is produced by the nervous system. Plants do not have a nervous system so it is very unlikely that they could feel emotions at all.	Killing an animal without causing suffering is equal to killing a plant. Both have the right to live.	Plants never felt and never will feel pain. It is true, that they might have a basic awareness of their surrounding and can react to stimulis, but plants all in all lack a brain and a nervous system. Whereas animals clearly express their pain by screaming, running away etc. Plants can not react this way.This fact suggest that they are not experiencing pain. It would be straight up cruel, if nature would have ''given'' plants the ability to feel pain, since they cant move and avoid it.	The fact that plants *might* feel pain does not justify causing definite pain to animals.	It's not simply pain but also suffering. There's no good evidence that plants are conscious so they cannot suffer in any meaningful way, even if they can react to a stimulus which could be called 'pain'.	The focus should be on minimizing suffering. Humans cannot survive without eating and it seems apparent that if plants suffer, they suffer less and qualitatively differently.	Plants are the bottom of the food chain. Nothing higher up the food chain can survive without plants being eaten. Humans cannot survive without plants in their food chain.	Raising farm animals ultimately kills more plants than raising plant foods, due to the amount of feed required to raise the animals.	Science might not be yet aware of the full spectrum of flora "feeling". We might, however, one day discover \(and are in the process of\) that they suffer and feel just like humans and other beings.	The alternative to eating meat on ethical grounds is eating plant based material. Plants, though, are life forms too. There is no alternative in which one eats inorganic matter or avoids killing. It is arbitrary and reductive to state that human life matters, and less complex animal life matters, but still less complex plant life does not. Consuming other species is inherent to human existence; It is naive to congratulate oneself on only killing and consuming a certain variety of life.

While much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. Ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources \(i.e. free range farming\) that afford animals the same \(if not better\) quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.	con	In many, if not most, places it is much more difficult or [expensive](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-money-chicken-organic/is-organic-chicken-worth-the-price-idUSKBN0FM24Q20140717) for consumers to purchase truly 'ethical' meat rather than to simply opt for a vegetarian option.	Even under an 'ideal' farming circumstances \(i.e. free range; painless death\) killing an animal still violates its right to life. To do so for such as simple \(and substitutable\) need such as food is immoral.	It is impossible to upscale 'ethically sourced' meat production to meet the huge demand for meat, in order to not change current meat consumption habits. 'Better consumer choice' is therefore impossible on a global scale.	Every sentient animal has the same moral status. You therefore can't treat pigs and cows as means to an end if you can't treat humans as means to an end.	Eating meat is not cruel and immoral if the animals that are being consumed are provided with humane living conditions, able to live full lives, and die of natural causes.	Animals cannot possibly enjoy the same quality of life that they'd have had in the wild if they were bred and raised with the sole purpose of being eaten.	The "free range" designation is not well regulated in the United States, and is more of a marketing term than a true indicator of how animals are treated. There are no rules enforcing the quality, size or degree of access to the outside.	It is immoral to bring creatures into existence in order to use and kill them. For example, it would be immoral to give birth to new children and use them as slaves or food.	Unlike wild animals, farmed animals are born explicitly due to human action. While we may have a duty to ensure that their lives are not unnecessarily cruel, it is not immoral to kill them for our own ends given they would not have existed otherwise.	Free range animals are often worse for the environment, [as they are more resource intensive in terms of land and less efficient in terms of food conversion](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2149220-grass-fed-beef-is-bad-for-the-planet-and-causes-climate-change/). Meanwhile, lower welfare animals benefit from efficiency of scale \(heat recapture in intensive farms for example\). Meat eaters must choose between welfare and the environment. Vegans need not make such a choice.	We can eat meat responsibly - choose carefully, develop small productions and local food, and make it a rare and savoured special dish.	The best way to incentivise humane and quality meat production is to buy and eat more from local farms. Avoiding meat entirely causes industrial meat factories to cut costs even more, leading to even more unethical production. Vote with your money.	Do means justify ends? We cannot argue the humaneness of raising animals for consumption when the end goal is their slaughter en masse anyway.	What is actually wrong is the treatment of animals in the  "meat industry", not the meat-eating itself. So, a change in the meat "production" would solve the problem, in a way that makes ceasing to eat meat unnecessary.	While is possible that ethical farms exist, there are no ethical slaughter houses. They are all horrifying death factories that expose animals to unimaginable stress and have terrible effect on human workers.	Nothing in the world had to be cruel, it just is. Facing the situation where animals are being constantly tortured in the name of bigger profits and simply advocate for a moral shift is an over simplification. Defend an ethical way to produce meat is a nice thing but not practical	Choosing to eat meat ethically is a luxury that many can't afford. Ethically produced meat is generally expensive and cheaper meat is generally amongst the least ethically produced.	All animals are not the same in their ability to grow meat while suffering. Good animal welfare \(and meat quality\) is highly correlated with high meat production rates in beef for example. There is a profit incentive to increasing animal welfare outcomes in this case. Therefore if consumers chose to eat meats of this type there would be financial incentives for the big meat producers to maximise animal welfare.	Animals can be raised in ways that cause little-no suffering, such as organically where they are free to roam outside and not fed things like growth hormones.	Despite attempts to advocate for better farming, farms are becoming more industrialised over time. See for example the graph [Annual Pig Crop Distribution by Size of Operation – United States: 1994-2014](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/rr171x21v/cz30pw658/js956j577/hogview-10-29-2015.pdf). There is no evidence that consumers can realistically reverse this trend.
in those cases, consumers could have a moral obligation to either purchase the expensive ethical meat or not purchase meat at all. this still would not imply that we should never eat meat.	3_1.8.14.1.1.

While they may have a right to be free of suffering, they do not have a right to life.	con	Claiming truth with no definition of the "right to life" or where this is a prerequisite to have desires about the future is not an argument. You have simply claimed these things as self evident truths. Also claimed animals are not self aware.  Which animals? Who said? When? etc.	Animals demonstrate their desires for the future through their actions. For example, they try to flee from danger and become panicked in slaughterhouses, so they clearly have specific desires about the future to not be killed.	One should err on giving more rights than less. Even if the essential prerequisites for rights are vague, we should err on respecting life rather than disrespecting it.	The main animal farming victims are examples of complex lifeforms that do not constitute borderline cases and should be given the right to life.

What is cruel is the factory farm system we use to get the meat. If we can get the meat without causing undue pain to the animal, there is no issue.	Animals are currently being treated horribly, but many meat eaters are using their sway as actual consumers to improve animals' living conditions. This combined attention and sway is sure to help animal rights in the long run.	Cruelty, being a trait derived from the human mind, is only applicable to meat consumption if it is done irresponsibly as compared to other consumers of meat in the animal kingdom.	Humans can make a choice to reduce the cruelty and immoral treatment of animals, as well as to reduce their consumption to a naturally sustainable amount.  This would be more likely to work if there weren't corporate "factories" for meat production--if humans were required to raise and/or hunt their own prey, and if there were distinct regulations disallowing and punishing animal cruelty on any spectrum.	Eating meat and cruel/immoral treatment of animals are not mutually exclusive - one can exist without the other. Large farms or "reserves" where animals are able to live a full and healthy life is a possible example. Likewise, it could also be assumed that ending the suffering for animals who are injured or already dying is more humane and less wasteful than allowing their suffering or wasting their remains.	Even free range farming violates the rights of animals by imprisoning them \(albeit in a larger enclosure\) and eventually killing them against their will.	Farm animals by definition cannot enjoy humane living conditions, since their freedom of movement will necessarily have to be violated.

This would only work if all other meat production was stopped. Maybe stopping meat consumption in the present is the most effective way to get this to come about.	Small productions cannot compete with large ones because they are small. It's already the case that most farms are small but most animals come from big farms, so adding more small farms won't help. For example, in the US in 2012: 57% of farms with cattle sold less than 20 cattle each, while 4.6% of all cattle came from such farms. 0.9% of farms sold at least 1000 cattle each, while 51% of all cattle came from such farms.

not eating the meat of animals killed for other purposes would be a waste and thus morally wrong.	3_1.8.24.	Not eating the meat of animals killed for other purposes would be a waste and thus morally wrong.	con	There are very few opportunities to eat animals killed by non-human causes. Eating only those animals would be very similar to not eating any meat at all.	Many religions use animal sacrifices. It would be a waste to not then eat those animals.	Selling meat from animals that have been killed anyway creates a demand for meat, which then encourages people to kill more animals than otherwise would have died.	Since a lot of institutions and professionals sustain that a diet that contains meat will necessarily cause a lot of health problems for the eater, not eating meat is not a waste. If someone doesn't want to drink poison, we would not say that they are 'wasting' poison.	Most of us wouldn't like the idea of eating a pet, regardless of its cause of death. Moral wrongness can vary depending on a person's view of how a dead body ought to be treated, and this subjective moral view varies wildly throughout culture, and from person to person.	We don't consider the food we feed to our pets "wasted". Every organism eventually "feeds" the ecosystem in which it dies \(including humans\), thus it's invalid to call organic matter objectively "wasted" simply because humans aren't the ones eating it.	Many societies, admittedly, less that are around today, [cannibalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannibalism) their dead for religious purposes, out of reverence for them.	Many animals that we eat or commodify were brought into existence by humans and would otherwise not exist. By reducing the demand for meat, we reduce the animals that are killed for any reason. Therefore, it is only a waste because we have created something we do not need.	Humans have morally acceptable reasons to kill animals besides eating them. If a human has a good reason to kill an animal it would be immoral to waste the edible sections of that animal.	In practice, yes, but to be precise, eating the flesh from dead bodies is not cruel nor immoral if the act can be shown to never create demand for the murdering of animals. A free-range animal that dies from natural causes could have its body eaten without causing any suffering. Anonymously eating murder meat purely from others' leftovers also causes no suffering. Necessarily cruel and immoral are the various acts of torture and finally the murder, not the flesh-eating part which has exceptions.

Consuming meat is an important part of many cultures and religions.	con	Some of the oldest forms of human expression and art are [cave paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting) of wild game, prey of humans. The chase and consumption of meat have therefore constituted a central component of human culture since its beginning.	Cultural components change over time: cultural transformation is a natural dynamic process.	In many cultures, a meatless diet plays an important cultural role.	Living on a meatless diet is not viable or stigmatized in some countries and regions.	Eating habits change, and meat has not always been an integral part of most cultures. Only [relatively recently](http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/GDPE/Distinguished_Ecologists/2006/Smil/Eating%20Meat.pdf) has the consumption of meat become wide-spread, for example during the mid-19th century in Europe and not until the mid-20th century in large parts of China.	Many religions explicitly permit or encourage eating animals.	People from rural areas will be ostracized if meat consumption falls because it is far more easy to raise animals than to plow the land.	A deliberate cultural evolution away from meat will overcome many current cultural issues with not eating meat.	Once a culture has the resources and technological knowhow to live in a way that avoids harms it previously needed for survival, that culture permanently progresses. Other cultures may have a valid argument for consuming meat or other [ESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy) such as raids involving murder of rival tribes' members. Western culture, with its great abundance and alternate foods, does not.	In the most world-renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.	Culture explains behavior but does not necessarily justify it.

Many religions explicitly permit or encourage eating animals.	con	According to Mormonism, God [created animals for our use, to eat sparingly](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89).	Biblical citations and religious assertions alone are not reasoned evidence.	As this is a moral statement, with no declarable moral code defined, the Bible even from a atheistic view is valid here. For example,  \(Romans 14\): "As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. 2 One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. 3 Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him."	No religion mandates eating animals.	In the Bible, God granted the animals to Noah and his family after the flood, saying "The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given. Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as I gave the green plant. Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood."	Meat was created by God for the righteous use of all of us, his children. The scriptures are eloquent, clear, and common sense on this topic. [1st Timothy Chapter 4 Verses 1-16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4?lang=eng)	In the Bible, God tells Adam and Eve not only to have dominion over all animals, but he also gives instruction in the mosaic law as to what types of animals you can and can’t eat. There are dozens more religions that promote certain diets that include meat.	Jainism encourages vegetarianism on the basis of ahimsa which is the principle of nonviolence and noninjury and is, in the case of Jains, applied to all beings.	If God created some living beings subservient to others, this would indicate God doesn't care about the welfare of some of his creations.	An omnibenevolent God would not create living beings that have the capacity to suffer with the purpose of being eaten and abused which results in suffering.

according to [cultural relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_relativism), judgement of right and wrong are determined by one's own culture and are thus not absolute.	3_1.9.11.12.1.	According to [cultural relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_relativism), judgement of right and wrong are determined by one's own culture and are thus not absolute.	con	Cultural relativism contradicts itself by arguing that moral principles are culturally dependent, and that we should therefore not impose our morality on others, because, the principle "we should not impose our morality on others" is not culturally dependent.	There are moral systems which can exist and be applied independently of culture, e.g. utilitarianism.
as there are no absolute standards for judging right and wrong, good and bad, as these terms are products of social agreement, individuals can only use their culture and the values / attitudes it has created for moral guidance. from this point of view, the dominant culture thus explains and justifies behavior.	3_1.9.11.13.	As there are no absolute standards for judging right and wrong, good and bad, as these terms are products of social agreement, individuals can only use their culture and the values / attitudes it has created for moral guidance. From this point of view, the dominant culture thus explains and justifies behavior.	con	Moral relativism is self-defeating in this case. Suppose all cultures should follow their own ethical codes. It then follows that if our culture's code says that eating meat is unethical, then we should condemn everyone who eats meat, no matter what culture they are from.	Some cultural practices are obviously wrong. For example, slavery and torture are wrong, even if most people once thought they were right. So there are some universal moral standards that exist independently of cultural opinion.	Moral relativism is a weak standard of morality, with no true consideration of why things are wrong, it is only an example of [stage 4 of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development). We need a better reason, a real reason why things are right, or wrong, like [overall happiness,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) [rights,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract)or [good will.](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/the-good-will/)	The fundamental moral truth, that pain and suffering in living beings should be minimized as much as possible, has to be the foundation of any discussion and has to supersede cultural values. Otherwise things like slavery and ritual killings would need to be considered morally OK, just because they are part of a certain culture. This would make argument-/logic-based discussions about what is morally right/wrong pointless. Thus, if such a discussion shall take place, culture can't be an argument.	According to meta-ethical [moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism) in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong.	According to [moral universalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_universalism), a system of ethics applies universally, that is, for all individuals, regardless of culture.	All humans are a part of a certain culture and society, which fundamentally characterizes their values and attitudes. Thus behavior of a certain culture can only be judged in comparison.

Though there may be some health benefits associated with eating meat, [many](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/10/meat-wars/599728/) humans typically eat much more of it than is healthy or necessary to obtain such benefits.	The human body does not require consumption of animal protein.	One of the foods with the [highest](https://www.healthaliciousness.com/articles/foods-highest-in-protein.php) protein to calorie ratio is cheese, which is not a meat product.	Meat is packed with protein. While there are other ways to get protein, lean meats are an extremely healthy and efficient way to obtain it.	Vegetarians/vegans generally consume a diet consisting of [less](http://www.livestrong.com/article/481795-the-statistics-of-vegetarians-vs-meat-eaters/) saturated fat and cholesterol than the average meat eater.	A meatless diet helps build healthy bones because vegetarians absorb more calcium than meat eaters.	[Good fats](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good) come mainly from vegetables, nuts, seeds; not from meat.	Without a carefully balanced diet non-meat eaters could suffer from certain deficiencies, like [protein](http://vegetarian.lovetoknow.com/Protein_Deficiency_Symptoms#Fur0di7vVrR60mUF.97) or [vitamin B12](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/guide/vitamin-b12-deficiency-symptoms-causes#1).	Maintaining a meatless diet in a meat-eating society is costly and requires nutrient planning.	Rapid evolution of humans was directly supported by the high protein diet of eating meat.  Meat diets provide more energy and nutrients that are more filling and energy efficient than plant based diets. Thus, precious time and energy is saved with the more efficient meat diet. Time and energy that can be used for different things like evolution, education, and technological advancements.	Vegetables do not sufficiently contain the nutrition needed by the human species, and additionally the much larger space requirements because of lower caloric density mean that relying on vegetation alone is not likely to be feasible, especially in comparison with the feasibility of creating ethically sound animal husbandry conditions and even changing to use less-neurologically-complex organisms as food sources, such as shrimp and aquaponics.	There is no one-size-fits-all regiment for optimal health and nutrition for human beings. It may very well be that some of us are more genetically wired to thrive on vegetable only diets while others need to metabolize meat.	Neal Barnard of the [Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine](http://www.pcrm.org/media/experts/neal-barnard) notes that when people switch from meat-eating to plant-eating, their intake of vitamins and other nutrients improves.	Plant protein products are improving. You can receive the same levels of proteins and vitamins without the chemicals and hormones found in meat products.

A [recent study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/11/07/1707322114) shows that vegan diets would not provide sufficient nutrition for the current population without supplementation potentially causing disease.	Meat is essential for a healthy diet, especially for developing and maintaining muscles.	The bioavailability of vegetable matter is much lower than meat for human beings. Not only is meat cellular tissue far more similar in constitution to our own cells than plant cells, but it is far easier, for example, to extract the majority of iron available in red meat than it is for us to extract iron present in vegetation such as spinach, only a small fraction of which is available.	Meat is the best source of [vitamin B12](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/1/131.long), a vitamin necessary for the nervous system and digestive system health.	It may be arguable that essential nutrients in meat are generally more bioavailable from those sources. For example, omega-3, choline. It is also arguable that mineral balances such as copper-zinc that are recommended for health are identical to that which one would receive from a meat heavier diet, rather than plants. Likewise saturated fats serve essential roles in the composition of hormones, in the brain, heart and liver. In other words, in the long run, a vegan diet may be harmful.	Meat has been shown to be an [important component](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174012003385) of a balanced diet.	Ceasing to eat meat can lead to health problems as replacing it with plant-based materials requires a plethora of different types of plants to get every nutrient needed.

There is [some evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137939/) that ceasing to eat meat would harm brains of those who are in the developmental age.	A Stone Age diet is the most natural and beneficial diet to the human gut. Meat and fats and some grains and fruit. Studies have shown that those people who follow this ancient way of eating are less susceptible to diabetes, heart disease and cancers. Take a look at this article which shows how fat is very important to the human diet.[files.meetup.com](http://files.meetup.com/1463924/Homo%20Carnivorous-WAPF2.pdf)	Some of the most healthful nutrients come exclusively or in greater bioavailability from animals sources: liver containing CoQ10, B vitamins, zinc, iron, chromium and other trace minerals, bone broth containing collagen supporting compounds such as hyluronic acid and glucosamine. While vegetarian diets can be healthful, they lack many nutrients that, while present in vegetables, have much less bioavailability. Humans thrive only when consuming moderate amounts of healthy animal food sources.	Animals process a vegetarian diet. Meat is the effect of that process - and this is why meat packs more nutrients in than vegetables. The organs and bones of the animal are particularly high in essential nutrients.	Eating just the cooked muscle is unhealthy. When meat is cured it increases it's bio availability and introduces good bacteria which facilitates digestion; coupled with eating bone broth and organs, eating meat in this way is extremely healthy.
