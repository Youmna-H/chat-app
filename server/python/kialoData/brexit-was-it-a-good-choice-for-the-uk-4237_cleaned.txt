Discussion Title: Brexit: Was it a good choice for the UK?

1. Brexit was a good choice for the UK.
1.1. Pro: It was a good choice simply because that's what people voted for.
1.1.1. Con: [Statistically speaking](https://www.thenewman.co.uk/blogs/research/brexit-remainers-vs-leavers), Pro-Brexit posts are significantly more likely to contain spelling and grammatical errors; inferring a trend towards lower literacy among proponents of this perspective.
1.1.1.1. Con: Just because someone is "educated" doesn't mean they know anything about international trading organisations or supranational governance. With this broad usage of "education" in mind, it's possible that the correlation is not caused by level of education but the demographic who tend to receive a higher standard of education, or the because of the attitude higher education inculcates.
1.1.1.2. Con: It could be argued on this fact alone that this is a classist issue where "educated people" \(mid to high class [correlates with education](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/21/english-class-system-shaped-in-schools)\) have become detached from the needs of the less educated ones \(most likely poor\). EU is great for the people that can actually afford traveling frequently and don't want to think about visas and paperwork too much.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Britain is not a communist state: there are no grounds to drag everybody down to the level of the least capable.
1.1.1.3. Con: This is an ad-hominem attack, so cannot be taken in itself as evidence for or against the pro-Brexit argument.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: It is not an attack on the voters who supported Leave to point out that they are less well educated than those who voted Remain. It is simply fact. [Studies](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted) have shown that University graduates are more likely to have voted Remain. This suggests that better education may have given us a different result. The obvious misinformation that was disseminated to win the Leave argument backs this narrative, as educated \(i.e. informed\) voters would have voted differently.
1.1.2. Con: Those who have always been against it still believe it is a bad thing and many of those who voted for it are not going to get what they think they voted for - immigration was a huge misunderstood factor in decision making and unlikely to satisfy the masses.
1.1.3. Con: A decision by majority vote does not necessarily mean it is a good decision.
1.1.3.1. Pro: If David Cameron had held a referendum "should every citizen of the UK be given a million pounds?" there would have been a large majority in favour. That doesn't mean it would have been a good idea.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Giving everybody a million pounds is not as daft an idea as it sounds since it would be a significant step towards reducing inequality. It would of course devalue the pound substantially, but that would only have a significant effect on those who have millions already.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: There are over 68m people in the UK. When you try to work out how much it would cost to give them each Â£1m, the calculator gives you an answer with letters in it.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: A million may be too much, nonetheless the principle is sound.
1.1.3.2. Pro: What the people voted for isn't necessarily going to stop them from regretting leaving the EU.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The correlation between "what people vote for" and "good choice" is shown to be flawed in history, when evil dictators have risen to power through the popular vote.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: The people should be trusted with their own vote. Whether they are voting against whatever incumbent they don't like or for some decision they might not see every consequence of, the inviolability of a vote is paramount to our society. Nobody is going to remove this right on the basis of past mistakes.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: This, however, doesn't mean that the public should be trusted with matters that fall far out of the majority's reach.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: [Less than half](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-68-95-99-7-rule-for-a-normal-distribution-b7b7cbf760c2) of the population are above average intelligence, so it is not smart to assume that the population will make good decisions.
1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: If the people are to be trusted with their vote, then we must presume that they understood the principles under which they were voting and voted accordingly. In this case, that they knew that the referendum was advisory and reasonably expected parliament to do its sworn duty.
1.1.3.4. Pro: The science behind voters manipulation is [so well understood](https://cyber.sci-hub.tw/MTAuMTA4MC8wNzM5MzE0OC4yMDE1LjExMjUxMTk=/gorton2016.pdf) Technology development by companies like Aggregate IQ have been [shown to be used](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/179107.htm)in the run up to the Brexit referendum
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: [Well designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q8xM8-XkRA) [adverts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44966969) were [targetted](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/revealed-how-vote-leave-targeted-facebook-users-during-brexit-referendum) at specific individuals selected through detailed analysis of their Facebook profiles. These were effectively hidden from the opposing campaign so they had no opportunity to [refute the lies](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-vote-leaves-dark-brexit-ads).
1.1.3.5. Con: [The referendum vote was not a decision](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2019/2381.html).
1.1.4. Con: The populations of Scotland and Northern Ireland voted against Brexit. [EU Referendum Results - bbc.co.uk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results)
1.1.5. Con: It's only what 52% of the electorate voted for, which doesn't even include under 18's.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Under 18s are going to be the ones more affected; they deserved more of a voice.
1.1.6. Con: Since the terms were not clear, it is entirely unclear what the people voted for. Hence the frustration with single market and customs union which were not on the ballot.
1.1.6.1. Pro: The slim 'majority' has now divided the country and left nearly half the voters with the impression that their opinion is being ignored, as hard-line Brexiters rush and push to a 'Hard Brexit' that even few 'Leavers' understood the consequences of when they put their cross in the box to leave.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Many people did not realise the complexity of such a decision.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The Brexit debate was highjacked by populists, who used emotional non-factual arguments regarding immigration, the NHS and sovereignty to mobilise support in large sections of the population, who are typically disengaged. Without this wilful misleading, the remain vote would have prevailed. Wide participation in politics is vital for democracy, however this needs to be supported by education in critical thinking and unbiased data & media, to enable people to make reasoned choices.
1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Emotional, non-factual arguments were widely used on both sides of the debate - not just the Leave side. It is not reasonable to assume that one side was influenced by this "wilful misleading" more than the other.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: There is no single interpretation of the "Leave" vote which truly represents the tiny majority that voted "Leave". Therefore, any particular Brexit strategy is likely to fragment the "Leave" voters into minorities.
1.1.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Equally, there are a range of views on the future of the EU on the Leave side, from committed federalists, to natural eurosceptics who voted out of fear of the unknown. The referendum campaign presented many different views on the future. People weighed these up to the best of their ability and the majority settled on Leave.
1.1.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: In spite of many claims today that "Brexit means Brexit" and "Of course Leave means leaving the Customs Union and Single Market". There was a lot [of talk](https://fullfact.org/europe/what-was-promised-about-customs-union-referendum/) from prominent Leave campaigners at the time of the referendum about the Norway Model and about remaining in the single market.
1.1.6.1.1.3. Pro: With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better if the referendum had been the final seal of approval after all of the complicated negotiations. Then we'd have known what we were voting for or against. As things stand, the majority of leave voters will be disappointed when their particular vision of Brexit does not come to pass. There will be widespread discontent among remainers and leavers alike. No one wins.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1. Con: [It was](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105). The EU refused any further negotiation [until article 50 was triggered](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/eu-commission-still-refuses-uk-talks-before-article-50-triggered).
1.1.6.1.1.3.2. Pro: There is increased clarity now on what Brexit would actually mean; the complexity and difficulty and problems are honestly laid out for anyone to see. As far as public opinion is concerned, that is a new political context; a context in which the initial vote didn't happen. Given the new clarity of the situation, a lot of minds may have been changed. Even in general terms \(let alone any specific practicalities\) Brexit may now represent a minority.
1.1.6.1.1.3.2.1. Con: It may now represent a minority. It may be unchanged. It may now represent an increased majority. This is pure speculation and does not support the argument one way or the other.
1.1.6.1.1.3.3. Con: With the benefit of hindsight, all manner of different things could have happened. Not the least of which, the duration between announcing the referendum and holding it would have enabled adequate time for the country to reflect on the decision it was going to make. Also with the benefit of hindsight, the question could have been clearer, a threshold could have been set, an independent body could have fact-checked both sides of the argument. Either way, hindsight in this argument is irrelevant.
1.1.6.1.1.4. Pro: There are more than 40 years of legislation and institutions to undo or rebuild. It just can't be done in two years, and all that time spent. Simply converting all EU laws to UK laws goes against the very reason to leave.
1.1.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: There are over three million Europeans in UK, and over one million UK citizens in the EU left with little guarantees at this point. All discussions on this topic are still at embryonic stage and create uncertainty.
1.1.6.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Both Brits on the mainland and EU citizens in Britain will be able to remain where they are. No government has the time or resources to deal with legal action against them by hundreds of thousands of individuals who would lose out financially and socially were they to have to leave. This issue will be settled with a form and a government stamp.
1.1.6.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: People may well be the victim of government neglect. The legal challenges may materialize only if the governments \(on both sides\) allow them through legislation. Other than that once the UK withdraws, in absence of other legally binding agreement, the rights of EU/UK citizens are automatically withdrawn as well.
1.1.6.1.1.4.1.2. Con: The [EU-UK joint statement of 8th December](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/joint_report.pdf) clarifies in detail how the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be protected.
1.1.6.1.1.4.2. Con: Transferring the legislation into UK law is a pragmatic, transitional measure to ensure continuity. Once the UK has left the EU, each law can be scrutinised by the UK parliament and modified, left untouched or repealed as we see fit and in our own time. This is the very essence of "taking back control".
1.1.6.1.1.5. Pro: Those commanding the 'Leave' campaign seem to regret it.
1.1.6.1.1.5.1. Pro: All of the main players in the campaign to leave deserted the ship on hearing the result but continue to snipe from the sidelines without taking responsibility for their actions. There should be a final vote put to the people on any deal reached, because the people that fought for Brexit are no longer in a position to dictate terms for the exit deal.
1.1.6.1.1.6. Con: The complexity of the decision has no bearing on whether it was a good choice.
1.1.6.1.1.6.1. Con: It had a bearing on whether the choice was made with enough clarity for that choice to be rational.
1.1.6.1.1.6.2. Con: It is better to toss a coin than to have complex decisions made by people who do not begin to grasp the relevant implications.
1.1.6.1.1.7. Con: It is up to the individual to ensure that they are well informed, educated and capable of making such a decision. Sufficient time was made for debate, research and questions to be asked. A reasonably capable person would not trust propaganda nor hearsay. Ultimately, if on decision day each individual did not feel equipped to make the choice, then they could abstain from voting, if required, rather than voting at random or using instinct for such an important event.
1.1.6.1.1.7.1. Con: The reality of Brexit was unknowable given its dependency on the unfolding of complex negotiations both within the UK and between the UK and the EU. As these have developed a clearer sense of the form and implications of Brexit is emerging and people should have the chance to base their choice for the UKâs future on this information that did not exist at the time of the 2016 referendum.
1.1.6.1.1.7.2. Con: It is the job of parliament to be well informed and make decisions. All that the electorate needed to do was to express an opinion. To abrogate such an important decision to the electorate would be a gross dereliction of duty.
1.1.6.1.1.8. Con: The people did not [make a decision](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html): they expressed an opinion and parliament [deferred the decision](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-01-31/debates/C2852E15-21D3-4F03-B8C3-F7E05F2276B0/EuropeanUnion\(NotificationOfWithdrawal\)Bill#contribution-4E407196-E047-424D-8243-C533B5E3647F) to the Prime Minister.
1.1.6.1.1.8.1. Con: Theresa May [did not realise](https://youtu.be/oRDfFJAu6Bo) the complexity of the decision.
1.1.6.1.1.8.1.1. Con: It is unrealistic to suppose that the Prime Minister of the nation, with the benefit of all her advisors and staff, did not realise the complexity of the decision: May knew it full well, but made her decision in simple terms of what her party wanted of her.
1.1.6.1.1.9. Pro: We elect representatives to do the right thing for the country as a whole and with a long term perspective, not the most popular thing. They should not have outsourced this complex decision to the the general public who were always more likely to vote in an emotional and short term way.
1.1.6.1.1.9.1. Pro: This is why we have a representative democracy in which referendums such as this one can only ever be advisory.
1.1.6.1.1.9.2. Con: We don't choose representatives based upon their intellect or morals or integrity, but rather their political allegiance. This does not confer a greater ability to make decisions.
1.1.6.1.1.9.3. Con: Parliament did not outsource this decision: the referendum was not binding. The Prime Minister of the day overstepped his authority in his promise to be bound by it.
1.1.6.1.1.9.3.1. Pro: The High Court confirmed that the result of the referendum was [not legally binding](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2768.html#para105), owing to the constitutional principles of parliamentary sovereignty and representative democracy. This was also [confirmed](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2019/41.html) by the UK Supreme Court.
1.1.6.1.1.9.3.1.1. Con: The [popular press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemies_of_the_People_\(headline\)) labelled the High Court judges as traitors: in a mediacracy their opinion hold more weight than the courts.
1.1.6.1.1.10. Pro: Brexit will cost a lot of money to the UK. This will have a trickle down effect on the citizens of the UK.
1.1.6.1.1.10.1. Pro: Based on direct costs such as job losses from the finance sector, as well as inflation eroding incomes and savings, Brexit will cost Britain [Â£300 million a week](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/04/brexit-european-union-negotiations/) over eight years. This means that less money will available for social security and unemployment benefits.
1.1.6.2. Pro: The Leave vote was driven by emotional arguments about regaining sovereignty. Very few who voted to leave understood the complexities arising from this decision, e.g. how to preserve Good Friday Agreement.
1.1.7. Con: Some of the negative implications of Brexit are now becoming apparent.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Inward investment in the UK has [slowed dramatically](https://www.ey.com/en_uk/attractiveness/19/uk-attractiveness-survey-special-regions-report) as potential manufacturing concerns are beginning to recognize the political and geographical disadvantages of locating, and indeed remaining in a post-Brexit UK.
1.2. Pro: Leaving the EU allows the UK to see the effects of leaving.
1.2.1. Pro: If the UK had not left, there would remain unanswerable questions about "what could have been", in perpetuity. Leaving will provide this answer, be it good or bad or mixed.
1.2.2. Con: Research and discussion should be the method for seeing if it's worth leaving the EU, not actually leaving the EU, and then seeing what happens. Only when the calculated risk of leaving is low enough should leaving be an option, not before. This is the premise of any decision that involves risk.
1.3. Con: The UK will always be seen as the country that decided to leave the party. This would impact its international image and relationships.
1.3.1. Pro: Brexit causes frictions with Scotland and Northern Ireland.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Continued membership of the EU was a significant factor in the [Scottish independence referendum](https://journals.openedition.org/rfcb/447).
1.3.1.2. Pro: Scotland is overwhelmingly pro-EU and has [questioned its ties with London and Britain](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36621030) over this decision. An unfavourable Brexit may also trigger further possibilities of an independent Scotland who wishes to remain in the EU.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Britain requires [food exports from the Republic of Ireland](https://www.ifa.ie/brexit/brexit-ireland/) which is in the EU and [can't produce enough](https://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/challenge/uk-threat/) food for its population on its own.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Just because Britain cannot produce enough food for its own population, it doesn't necessarily mean it must import from Ireland specifically.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Brexit makes no sense for Northern Ireland whose border with the Republic of Ireland is over [300 miles long and has 275 crossing points](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40949424). Furthermore, ignoring farms that cross the border would make a hard land border unenforceable \([p. 7](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmniaf/329/329.pdf)\).
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Brexit will very likely lead to the reunification of Ireland.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The reunification of Ireland could take a long time.
1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Ireland was partitioned a [century ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland). A few more years will make little difference.
1.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: After Northern Ireland voted Remain with a 55.8% majority, there were [immediate calls for a border poll](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/09/irish-unification-brexit/) to vote through referendum to unify.
1.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: The reunification of Ireland is also supported by some Northern Ireland politicians.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Northern Ireland's deputy leader [Martin McGuinness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McGuinness) remarked that â[there is a democratic imperative for a âborder poll.â](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-ireland/sinn-fein-calls-for-irish-unity-poll-as-brexit-fallout-begins-idUSKCN0ZA0NX)â
1.3.1.5. Con: Brexit is only a foil for pre-existing tension by professional political agitators.
1.3.1.6. Con: Scotland reduced it's support of the separatist SNP, considerably, in the Scottish elections following Brexit. [\("The first minister admitted that her call for a second referendum immediately after Brexit was a key factor in the Scottish National partyâs loss of 21 of 56 Westminster seats,"\)](http://The first minister admitted that her call for a second referendum immediately after Brexit was a key factor in the Scottish National partyâs loss of 21 of 56 Westminster seats,)
1.3.1.6.1. Con: The general election was strongly presented as "Support Theresa May" or "Remove Theresa May". In a First Past The Post system such polarisation makes voting for anyone but the two main parties a greater risk of the "wrong" party winning the seat. People who wanted to prevent Theresa May gaining greater majority tactically voted in the election.
1.3.1.7. Pro: Some people voted Brexit to end freedom of movement between the UK and the EU, which means [ending freedom of movement between Ireland and NI](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-44615404). If freedom of movement doesn't end, people will not get the restrictions they hoped for. If they did, it would be a [problem for those in NI and Ireland](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/ireland-brexit?).
1.3.2. Pro: Being in the EU helps the UK negotiate on the world stage with the weight of [512M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union) people and the cost of negotiation spread across 27 countries. Unilateral negotiation of deals alone represents only 60M people and the deal was renegotiated 27 times.
1.3.3. Pro: There is strength in numbers. This is particularly important when traditional alliances are fraying. Instead of dumping the EU the UK should have been more actively working to fix its faults.
1.3.4. Con: The UK left the party legally, cordially, and with fair warning, thus Brexit is unlikely to tarnish the UK's international standing and relationships.
1.3.4.1. Con: Given the number of items in the withdrawal agreement that the UK government has welshed on, not to mention all the [lies that they tell](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/list-of-brexit-lies) to their own citizens, the UK will almost certainly be seen as duplicitous.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The United Kingdom exercised a legal right through [Article 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_invocation_of_Article_50_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union) to leave the European Union. It didn't walk away without warning or mechanism.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The decision to leave was well telegraphed with David Cameron going to the EU prior to calling the referendum seeking [renegotiations](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34770875).
1.3.5. Pro: The UK has always had a privileged position within the EU, with [special rules](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_renegotiation_of_European_Union_membership,_2015â16) that do not apply to other member states. Leaving a strong economic block will weaken the negotiation position of the country and will leave it more vulnerable to unfair conditions from other giants such as the USA and China.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Brexit was definitely not a good choice for the UK, as can be seen with the current media speculation on the potential consequences. However, the British public have spoken, and thus, Brexit will, in all likelihood, go ahead. This will probably benefit the other 27 countries, who can carry on their cooperation without constantly having to worry about the one country which tries to veto everything or get special treatment.
1.3.6. Pro: This is correct. In a sense it is unfortunate, but the media contributed to disinformation, be it by 40 years of lies in the tabloids and by the BBC's [biased coverage](https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-07-29/bbc-policy-not-impartial-on-brexit/) in the run up to the referendum. This made the British public make an ill-informed decision, the consequences of which are yet to be seen and which will need to be put up with.
1.3.7. Pro: The United Kingdom needs alliances in order to realize its advantages \(financial center, research & technological know-how\); the natural partners are its historical colonies - the Commonwealth & the US. Stability with the âContinent,â however, which would leverage the UKâs advantages, was easier within the EU than outside it, in the medium to long term.
1.3.8. Con: There are 28 countries "at the party" and 167 who have never been invited. Many countries outside the EU see it as [protectionist](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44291103). Leaving will help us build closer relationships with these countries.
1.3.8.1. Con: The EU is protectionist. The relevant question becomes one of whether we want that protection to protect us, or to protect them from us.
1.3.8.2. Con: Most [countries with advanced economies](http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC\@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD) are in the European Union or have an established [trade agreement with the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/negotiations-and-agreements/). New negotiations would need to take place which may not be of as much benefit to the UK.
1.3.8.3. Con: "Protectionist" is a positive if you are currently a member. Protections to safeguard jobs and workers rights against cheap imports from 3rd world nations who disregard workers rights and safety in order to gain competitive advantage.
1.3.8.4. Con: The EU is the [most open to developing countries](https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/index_en.htm) as any other market in terms of trade.
1.3.8.5. Pro: The EU Commission is not afraid to use its regulatory powers to [protect and boost its own tech sector](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-protectionism-trade-technology-defense-environment/).
1.3.8.6. Pro: The EU has a policy of [agricultural protectionism](https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/eu-dabbles-in-agricultural-protectionism-says-perdue) under the guise of quality and safety standards, especially in relation to GMO foods.
1.3.9. Con: The decision to leave the party will be insignificant in comparison to the conduct of the nation's representatives throughout the withdrawal negotiations.
1.4. Con: Brexit has inspired far-right movements in Europe.
1.4.1. Pro: Hate crime and racial violence has [surged](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/hate-crime-surged-since-brexit-vote/17/10/) since around the time of the Referendum.
1.4.1.1. Pro: In the 3 months after the referendum, more than [14,000 hate crimes](https://www.stophateuk.org/tag/brexit/) have been reported which is more than a 50% increase on the previous 3 months.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Stop Hate UK has recorded an [increase of 32%](https://www.stophateuk.org/tag/brexit/) in reported hate crimes and racial violence overall after the Referendum.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The police forces in England have reported race and faith-based hate crimes increase by more than [40%](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/racist-hate-crimes-surge-to-record-high-after-brexit-vote-new-figures-reveal-a7829551.html) since the Brexit vote.
1.4.2. Con: Far right movements were [present before Brexit](http://time.com/4075396/far-right-politics-rise-europe/), and seem to be more associated with frustrations regarding EU policy.
1.4.3. Pro: Far-right groups all over Europe [celebrate](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexit-eu-referendum-latest-far-right-celebrations-news-marine-le-pen-a7101371.html) the victory of the Brexit vote.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Franceâs Front National \(FN\) [hailed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/european-far-right-hails-britains-brexit-vote-marine-le-pen) Brexit as a clear boost for Marine Le Penâs presidential bid next spring, as well as a move that gave momentum to the partyâs anti-Europe and anti-immigration line.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The far right Sweden Democrats, who hold the balance of power in Stockholm, [tweeted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/european-far-right-hails-britains-brexit-vote-marine-le-pen): âCongratulations to Britainâs people on choosing independence! Now we are waiting for a #swexit!â
1.4.3.3. Pro: In the Netherlands, the far right and anti-immigration leader, Geert Wilders [called for a referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/european-far-right-hails-britains-brexit-vote-marine-le-pen) on Dutch membership of the EU following the Brexit vote.
1.4.4. Con: Brexit is a democratic decision that will address those negative feelings in a positive, constructive way and will actually defuse the rise of the far-right in the UK rather than promote it.
1.4.4.1. Pro: UKIP [collapsed](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/ukip-vote-collapse-puts-paul-nuttall-leadership-in-danger) during and after the 2017 UK general election on a similar basis.
1.4.4.2. Con: There was a [sharp increase](https://fullfact.org/crime/hate-crime-england-and-wales/) in hate crime and racist incidents following the referendum.
1.4.4.3. Con: [Appeasement](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-britain-hoped-to-avoid-war-with-germany-in-the-1930s) never works.
1.5. Pro: In the long term, it will provide economic value to the UK.
1.5.1. Pro: Leaving the EU will provide lots of well paid UK jobs, paid by UK tax payers, as we duplicate existing things like the medicines agency, nuclear safety, air safety etc, as well as provide lots of work for lawyers who will need to re-write a lot of contracts. Duplicated British jobs for British people paid for by increasing British taxes.
1.5.1.1. Con: Having to spend money duplicating work is a net economic loss. The money would be better spent creating new opportunities, rather than trying to make up for the loss of old ones.
1.5.1.2. Con: These services did not need duplication; and arguably if duplicated cannot function as well as the original, collaborative and integrated ones. Duplicating them will take time, leaving disorder \(cost, time\) in the meantime.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Furthermore, medicines, aircraft and other products are only made by finite producers. These producers will align to the bigger market, not our peculiar, smaller one, because it will make no financial sense for them to do so. So we will have access to fewer or worse services.
1.5.2. Con: The UK economy is faring badly and [economic experts](http://uk.businessinsider.com/oecd-report-uk-economy-brexit-2017-10?r=US&IR=T) are warning that [reversing Brexit](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/brexit-economy-exports-gdp-records-not-what-leave-voters-wanted-a7993426.html) is the way to solve that, not continuing.
1.5.3. Pro: The UK [contributes more](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) than it receives. Add in [free movement](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/key-topics/public-services-infrastructure) and people using services they have not contributed to and the reason for services struggling becomes clear. The EU is draining us of financial resources. It will take some years to level itself, but the UK will be better off out.
1.5.3.1. Con: Our net contributions to the EU are around [Â£9 billion a year](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7886/CBP-7886.pdf), after the rebate and the money invested in the UK from the EU budget are taken into account. In return for this we have freedom of movement of goods, tariff free access to our largest trading partner, lack of mobile roaming charges in the EU and a variety of other benefits. [Studies show](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/09/18/eu-migrants-worth-public-finances-uk-born-study-claims/) that EU residents pay more tax than UK adults do. Yes, we pay for access, but we get benefits in return.
1.5.4. Con: [OECD report](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/06/no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-uk-economy-into-recession-oecd) suggests that Brexit with no deal \(as the current outlook appears to be\) would cost Â£40bn in lost growth by 2019. It will take a long time to see that recovered.
1.5.5. Con: After Brexit the economy will take a large hit, each individual citizen will be poorer by even more than the average Â£600 a year each [loss since the Brexit referendum](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-uk-economy-losses-eu-referendum-result-billions-leave-european-union-a8081841.html), and there will be no '[Brexit Bonus](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/no-theresa-isnt-giving-nhs-12726157)' when we leave.
1.5.6. Pro: The pound sterling has [already dropped](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/04/brexit-european-union-negotiations/) from over 1.50 to 1.25 against the US dollar under its EU membership. In the long term, Brexit will help the currency regain its value.
1.5.7. Con: If any, it's going to take a lot of time before seeing the economic benefits.
1.5.7.1. Pro: It is hard to see how one could think that leaving an economic system that brought peace for over 50 years could bring any good.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: There is no evidence the EU, as opposed to NATO, has brought peace.
1.5.7.1.2. Con: With the EU becoming "an ever closer union" it is not unthinkable that in maybe 50-100 years the EU will become a fully sovereign country. If that is something someone does not see as a positive thing, one might be right to consider leaving.
1.5.7.1.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #6351: The European Union should become a United States of Europe.
1.5.7.1.3. Con: This seems an irrelevant point to the UK leaving unless there is concern that the EU27 will go to war with the UK, or vice versa.
1.5.7.1.4. Con: Arguably, EU actions contibuted to the wars in the former Yugoslavia and more recently the civil war in Ukraine. Within the EU we have had terrorism in Spain and the UK.
1.5.7.1.4.1. Con: The EU won the 2012 Nobel prize for the advancement of peace and reconciliation over 6 decades.
1.5.7.1.4.2. Con: The weaknesses of the European Political Cooperation in the yugoslavia wars were addressed in the creation of the [Common Foreign and Security Policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy), as one of the three pillars of the European Union.
1.5.7.1.4.3. Con: The Ukrainian situation remains complex and difficult and [not solely the responsibility](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-eu-broke-ukraine-with-help-from-russia/) of the EU.
1.5.7.1.4.4. Con: The EU [had a role](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-42412972) in building relationships leading into the Good Friday Agreement.
1.5.7.1.4.5. Con: Terrorism also [exists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_terrorist_incidents_by_country) outside the EU.
1.5.7.2. Pro: The global markets feel this financially as London, a leading global financial centre, is likely to diminish in its influence and posture. The flow of global funds may begin to find new harbours outside of the isolated London.
1.5.7.2.1. Pro: The UK does not know what its doing. The reason why 'Pound' was so strong, was because big [enterprises](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bmw-to-shut-uk-mini-factory-for-one-month-immediately-after-brexit-amid-nodeal-fears-a3939061.html) like [Michelin](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1548891/Michelin-to-close-British-factory.html), HSBC have their main Europe Headquarters there. [Brexiting](https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/01/13/how-will-british-firms-replace-departing-european-workers) will cause loss of [1000's of jobs](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/04/will-nissan-stay-once-britain-leaves-sunderland-brexit-business-dilemma) and the main companies headquarters moving to France and Germany.
1.5.7.3. Con: This is pure supposition.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: [Under current statistics](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-leaked-impact-assessment-economy-gdp-north-east-west-midlands-a8199746.html) published by the UK government and other independent bodies, the UK economy will be comparatively worse off under Brexit than remaining within the EU.
1.5.7.3.1.1. Pro: Brexit supporters are planning for [30 years of economic pain](https://twitter.com/andyoakes/status/1129462984764547072?s=09).
1.5.7.3.1.2. Pro: Almost nobody who is not already a multi millionaire has any real chance of being better off even in the very long term if the UK leaves the EU. Unemployment will rise and the economy will [never reach](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-cost-how-much-uk-economy-money-spent-a8854726.html) the [potential](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46366162) it could have had [staying in](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/07/investing/brexit-banks-moving-assets/index.html).
1.5.7.3.1.3. Pro: Money lost during the years before tariffs and the costs of bureaucratic [delays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing#Objectives_and_benefits) can be eliminated will cost us more on an ongoing basis from investments not made, savings not made by buying in bulk, and interest not earned.
1.5.7.3.1.4. Pro: In the case of a "no deal" scenario, there is cliff edge risk. This will cost much more than any plausible and more optimistic benefit driven by Brexit.
1.5.7.3.2. Con: The UK [has already lost](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-uk-economy-office-for-budget-responsibility-no-deal-gdp-investment-inflation-a8579306.html) Â£500 million a week due to the decline in GDP growth relative to what it would have been if the vote hadn't occurred.
1.5.7.3.2.1. Pro: The GBP will likely lose value in order to sustain trade.
1.5.7.3.3. Con: There is no evidence to suggest there will ever be any economic benefits.
1.5.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.3.2.
1.5.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.3.1.
1.5.7.6. Pro: The EU removed bureaucracy, for businesses and citizens by enabling the free movement of goods, services, cash and people. Brexit means bureaucracy.
1.5.7.6.1. Pro: The advantage of the European Union and the single market is that it provides British companies with a much larger market for sales which will no longer be available under the same conditions. To sell into Europe will require Britain to pay unilaterally for the cost of developing standards and demonstrating compliance with EU standards.
1.5.7.6.2. Con: Bureaucracy is job creation.
1.5.7.7. Con: There are other factors to consider, not just economic ones.
1.5.7.7.1. Pro: For a country deeply divided by economic and social rifts, the Brexit decision was also about finding [unity](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/04/brexit-european-union-negotiations/).
1.6. Pro: The UK will have more freedom and sovereignty to make decisions that will make a difference, without vetting of the EU.
1.6.1. Con: The UK will have less influence internationally, hence less influence over matters that make a difference.
1.6.1.1. Con: The UK will continue to have a seat at the G7, the G20 and the UN security council. All this from the world's [5th largest economy](https://www.fa-mag.com/news/the-world-s-biggest-economies-in-2018-39645.html). Added to this, the UK stands at the top of the [Soft Power 30](https://softpower30.com/) list of 2018. Surely this is convincing evidence enough that the UK can make a success out of itself outside the realm of an integrationist political union.
1.6.2. Con: Stepping out of the EU will likely result in a trade-deal like that of Norway; they are very costly and come with a lot of [similar restrictions](https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/03/22/theres-something-fishy-about-britains-brexit-transition-deal) to being in the EU. So basically the only real difference that results of Brexit, is that the UK no longer has a vote regarding European issues. Issues that clearly do concern the UK.
1.6.3. Pro: UK would get more sovereignty of their own borders again, getting to be more selective of who can come into their country.
1.6.3.1. Pro: With no more open border policy there would be less immigration; less immigration means citizens will have less competition for jobs.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: [Research](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/the-truth-about-wages-and-immigration-emerges-at-last) has indicated that immigration has little impact on jobs and wages.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: The EU accounts for [less than half](https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/) of our immigration numbers, and immigration from outside the EU, which has entirely been under the Government's control has risen, so there is no evidence that the Government having complete control over borders will lead to a drop in immigration.
1.6.3.1.3. Con: Immigrants are mainly in jobs that locals either don't want to do \(low paid, low qualifications\) or cannot do with the qualifications they already hold \(high skilled jobs\).
1.6.3.1.4. Con: Bringing high skilled professionals from somewhere else means that the government is saving money as they don't need to [train those workers](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/406760/bis-15-153-impacts-of-migrant-workers-on-uk-business.pdf).
1.6.3.2. Con: The UK government has complete control over non-EU migration, yet has done little to limit it. There is no reason to think that this would change post-Brexit, in fact restrictions may be relaxed to encourage skilled workers to come.
1.6.3.3. Con: [UK immigration policy](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43364331) is driven by xenophobia and racism, so loss of freedom of movement is only likely to make it worse.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: The UK needs migrants for its economy and NHS, and replacing Europeans with South Asians and Africans is unlikely to please racists and xenophobes.
1.6.3.3.2. Con: A subjective quote from an EU-phile like Cable does not suffice as evidence that the UK's current immigration policy is, in any way, driven by racism.
1.6.3.3.3. Pro: The [hostile environment policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office_hostile_environment_policy), which has led to victims not reporting crime, contributes to homelessness and leaves people open to exploitation, is driven by a government pandering to the views of people who [don't](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/17/socially-isolated-voters-more-likely-to-favour-brexit-finds-thinktank) [know](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brexit-voters-are-less-bright-than-remainers-7nk8s3272) [what](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-leave-eu-immigration-main-reason-european-union-survey-a7811651.html) [they're](https://fullfact.org/immigration/pensioners-or-refugees/) [worried about](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138), whose [negative attitudes](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/) towards immigration [aren't based](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/immigration-migration-advisory-committee-productivity-skill-gdp-brexit-a8542841.html) in [reality](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/).
1.6.3.4. Con: UK citizens will lose their freedom of movement rights as well, limiting their ability to travel and live/work in other countries.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: Complete loss of freedom of movement rights would result in a flood of [over a million](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/british-expats-marry-european-eu-citizen-brexit-a7118646.html) UK citizens being forced to return, many of them elderly and homeless and in need of expensive care.
1.6.3.5. Con: Immigration laws for non-EU immigrants are unlikely to change. The change in immigration laws for EU immigrants means that the UK becomes less attractive and, therefore, highly skilled EU immigrants are more likely to leave the country \(as they have other options\) and new one prefer other countries, with a less hostile environment. [blogs.lse.ac.uk](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/09/18/defining-highly-skilled-migration-the-mismatch-between-income-and-labour-market-position/)
1.6.4. Pro: The UK wouldn't have to pay [12+/-billions a year](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4894658/How-does-UK-pay-EU.html) to the EU, which means less tax for taxpayers.
1.6.4.1. Con: This is simply incorrect. Brexit is more likely to lead to [tax hikes](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/15/brexit-could-lead-to-tax-hikes-and-spending-cuts-warns-uk-finance-minister.html) and reduced spending than reduced taxes.
1.6.4.2. Con: The UK will continue to pay much of that, to cover existing commitments and for access to organisations and schemes that it needs.
1.6.5. Pro: The UK would get full rights to [their own fishing waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Fisheries_Policy), and won't have to toss out [tons of dead fish](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/787557/eu-common-fisheries-policy-125000-dumping-sea-bass-fixed-quota-allocation-fishing) just because they were the wrong kind of fish/went over the quota of fish they could catch.
1.6.5.1. Con: These EU strictures exist for a reason. Overfishing is a [serious issue](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/overfishing) and the UK will still have to enforce some limits.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: The current state of fisheries is bad. \([1](http://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/SOWF_FINAL_July071.pdf)\) It's assumed that by 2048 lots of fisheries will have collapsed due to overfishing.
1.6.5.2. Con: The UK will lose access to EU fishing waters unless it trades away some of its own, so won't ultimately end up any better off.
1.6.5.3. Con: Fish move around, and outside the EU, the UK will have greatly reduced ability to protect areas where fish mature before moving to UK waters where they can be caught.
1.6.6. Con: Currently, Parliamentary sovereignty is being subverted by the Government, not the EU. Parliament's power to block no-deal and even to reverse Brexit \(which has a Parliamentary majority\) is being [usurped](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/british-parliament-must-reassert-its-sovereignty-and-reverse-brexit-1.3251160).
1.6.6.1. Con: However, Parliament voted to trigger Article 50, when they could have voted against. We have sufficient legal protection and independence in our courts, in the House of Lords and even in the House of Commons to ensure the government cannot ignore Parliament.
1.6.7. Con: The UK's political system is flawed. Parliament does not accurately reflect how people voted. In the [first-past-the-post system](https://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk/first-past-the-post/), many often claim to vote tactically or make protest votes as a form of punishment or sending a message. The young people and EU citizens who will be most affected by Brexit could not vote. Consequently, many of them will disagree with the claim that they have more freedom or sovereignty.
1.6.8. Pro: The EU's [copyright bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP3HJ1YYrgs), which includes article 11 \(link tax\) and 13 \(upload filter\), will greatly affect how we use the internet; this is reason enough to leave the EU.
1.6.8.1. Con: A single measure is not sufficient reason to leave the entire union.
1.6.8.2. Con: The copyright seeks to protect artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, photographers and journalists. The UK is one of the [world's leading creative hubs](https://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/projects/hubs/) and therefore many of its citizens, news agencies and small businesses would benefit from increased copyright protection of this nature. By staying within the EU, the UK could continue to influence the nature of this law, rather than just being a rule-taker on the outside.
1.6.9. Pro: The number of areas of policy where the EU has competency to make laws has steadily grown over time from 11 areas in the original 1957 [Treaty of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome), to 27 areas at the [Treaty of Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon). This represents a gradual shift in sovereignty away from the UK parliament and towards the EU institutions.
1.6.9.1. Con: Lots of these areas of competence establish global standards, by the sheer size of the EU, and the UK is leaving the table where it is decided, and so will necessarily become a rule taker not a rule maker.
1.6.9.2. Con: Such a move by the EU was done in full agreement and the option to veto from the UK at every step.
1.6.9.3. Con: As part of the EU, UK was part of the global evolution. It is not about EU ruling the UK, but about common share of ideology.
1.6.9.4. Pro: A small sovereign country can make quick decisions and be more flexible. In a fast changing world this is more beneficial to the citizens of that country then being part of a massive union where your voice is one of many.
1.6.9.4.1. Con: Stability is good for citizens, especially workers who rely on strong employment rights. Flexibility usually just means taking away important rights and protections.
1.6.9.4.2. Con: The UK is a small land mass, but it has a high population and is a G8 country. It has power, influence and agility already. If it remained part of the EU, it could exert that power and influence on the largest trading bloc in the world whilst also retaining benefits and freedoms within the bloc.
1.6.9.4.2.1. Pro: [Freedom of movement](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/freedom-of-movement-eu-uk-brexit-negotiations-theresa-may) of goods and labor within the EU, freedoms of [lower prices](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47401160), increase standards and increase opportunity are some of the benefits the UK is able to get by being a part of the EU.
1.6.9.4.3. Pro: A good example of such a decision-making flexibility is New Zealand.
1.6.9.5. Pro: The EU is not a [democratic institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_legitimacy_of_the_European_Union). Only the [unelected European Commission](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/06/21/is-the-eu-really-run-by-unelected-bureaucrats/) can decide the agenda, by proposing legislation. The European Parliament can only slow down their agenda by vetoing it - they cannot stop the agenda, and certainly cannot change it.
1.6.9.5.1. Con: Every member of the commission is appointed by an elected body. Who gets appointed is decided by who voters choose as their government in each member state.
1.6.9.5.2. Pro: The EU leaders are not elected by the British people and should not dictate over them.
1.6.9.5.2.1. Con: Members of the European Parliament are elected and have the right to govern over all countries in the EU, not just Britain.
1.6.9.5.2.2. Con: All [EU leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament) are either directly elected \(MEPs, heads of state\) or appointed by elected officials.
1.6.9.5.3. Pro: The UK will no longer be under the authority of the European Courts and legislation made locally will have primacy. This will increase the power of democratic decisions and foster democratic involvement.
1.6.9.5.3.1. Con: This will result in the loss of [vital protections and human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights) that are enforced by the European Courts.
1.6.9.5.3.2. Con: Not all courts with "European" in the name, and whose judgements the government agrees to abide by, are EU related; these would not be affected by Brexit.
1.6.9.5.3.2.1. Pro: The European Court of Human Rights, for example, is a [part of](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/what-is-the-european-convention-on-human-rights) the UK's Council of Europe membership and treaties.
1.6.9.5.4. Con: The lack of a direct vote for the European commission is troublesome, however would it not be better to change this from the inside of the EU, rather than throw the whole thing away and start again.
1.6.9.5.4.1. Pro: The House of Lords is [unelected](http://www.democraticaudit.com/2018/10/02/audit2018-how-undemocratic-is-the-house-of-lords/) and yet the UK has decided to begin reforming it, instead of throwing the whole idea of the UK out the window.
1.6.9.5.5. Pro: The European Commission can always resubmitting its rejected proposals under different wording, and it only takes one successful vote to secure it forever, regardless of how many failed votes beforehand.
1.6.9.6. Con: Nations, as fully formed sovereign entities so prized by a fervent right wing, have [not existed for very long](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_date_of_formation) in the grand scheme of things. The development of legal jurisdictions has developed along with greater complexity of human societies and tended towards centralisation.
1.6.10. Con: Sovereignty is an emotive term - in reality, no nation is truly sovereign as it is constrained by multiple supranational treaties, designed, like the EU, for the common good.
1.6.10.1. Con: Common good is an emotive term - in reality, the intent of design of a supranational treaty will not necessarily correlate with its actual results, and in fact it might be an obstacle since fervent actions taken with emotion might be difficult to let go by its proponents even when facing failure multiple times.
1.6.10.2. Con: Sovereignty is a real thing, used to create and agree to relationships. All wills \(individual or group\) are sovereign since it is only that will that can decide if it agreements are honored that were made in the past, present and into the future.
1.6.10.3. Pro: UK's sovereignty may be mitigated as it signs new trade deals, each with its own demands and restrictions.
1.6.10.3.1. Pro: Leaving without a deal will put the UK at a disadvantage in negotiations for new trade relations with other nations. This may mean greater restrictions on our "sovereignty" than those we have within the EU.
1.6.10.4. Pro: The complexity and depth of the UK's relationship with its closest trading partners is reflected in laws and regulations. Without them - every interaction has friction. The benefits of common laws and regulations are massive and tangible, whereas 'sovereignty' is subjective and ill-defined
1.6.11. Pro: The UK will have more freedom to negotiate trade deals. The EU has not been proactive enough at this.
1.6.11.1. Con: The UK's trades with the EU account for [more than 40%](https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/) of its exports.
1.6.11.2. Con: The EU has just signed a [huge trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/18/what-future-for-britain-as-the-eu-strikes-a-trade-deal-with-japan) with Japan which the UK will soon no longer benefit from.
1.6.11.2.1. Pro: This trade deal could create greater incentives for Japanese countries to invest in the EU27, rather than Britain. If the UK do not replicate the EU's trade deal with Japan, it "could clearly see investment flowing to countries in the single market."
1.6.11.3. Con: It appears that the ruling Conservative party in the UK is still [split](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/12/deal-no-deal-labour-tories-brexit-may-corbyn) over Brexit, as evidenced by the reaction to the Prime Minister's proposals. A divided Government will find it difficult to negotiate favourable terms.
1.6.11.4. Con: Currently, any new trade deals will be signed while the UK has a significantly smaller economy and therefore weaker negotiating stance. The UK will have freedom to negotiate different trade deals, but they may well be [worse](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/06/us-escalates-trade-dispute-with-uk-and-canada-over-bombardier-jets) than what we can achieve from within the EU.
1.6.11.4.1. Con: Bombardier is a [Canadian company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Inc.), not a UK one.
1.6.11.4.1.1. Con: But it does employ [3,500 people](https://uk.bombardier.com/en/about-us/bombardier-in-country.html) in the UK.
1.6.11.4.2. Pro: The UK will lose the freedom to trade with the largest trading bloc in the world; or will have to re-negotiate that at a greater cost than already exists.
1.6.11.4.3. Pro: The colossal size of the EU market, compared to the UK alone, gives EU deals more potential negotiation power.
1.6.11.5. Pro: Within the EU, trade deals have to be ratified by all member states. For some states, [this also implies ratification by regional parliaments within the states](https://www.ft.com/content/df6841f4-113e-3b56-9559-61bcc6c3ed11). This need for unanimity necessarily means that negotiations take longer and are less tailored towards the specific needs of individual member states.
1.6.11.5.1. Con: The biggest trade deal that the UK has to negotiate after Brexit is with the EU, so the issue of delay caused by the EU's requirement for unanimity applies in some measure to the UK outside the EU as well.
1.6.11.6. Pro: It provides an opportunity to sign stronger trade deals with the US.
1.6.11.6.1. Con: The US is becoming more [isolationist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbrinkley/2018/03/21/what-trump-calls-nationalism-looks-more-like-isolationism/) in its trade policies.
1.6.11.6.2. Con: The UK, outside of the EU, has less to offer the US in both market size and geopolitical influence. Thus it will get less favorable terms than as part of the EU.
1.6.11.6.3. Pro: Trump has promised [better trade deals](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/trump-uk-us-trade-deal-brexit-eu-leave-theresa-may-china-talks-national-emergency-a8781606.html) after Brexit.
1.6.11.6.3.1. Con: [Not everything](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/04/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/) Donald Trump says is true.
1.7. Pro: It will allow the UK to improve the NHS.
1.7.1. Con: Brexit has [cost a fortune](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/brexit-set-to-cost-the-uk-more-than-200-billion-by-the-end-of-the-year/16/06/) so far, and is set to cost even more, given the number of customs officials and other administration. The NHS is unlikely to survive at all.
1.7.2. Pro: The NHS will have more [budget](http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/briefing_cost.html).
1.7.2.1. Con: Any increase in NHS spending will have to come from heavier taxation. The Tories are [ideologically opposed](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tories-taxes-robert-halfon-aging-population-nhs-a8348281.html) to that, even though they have pledged to increase NHS spending substantially, it is unlikely to actually happen.
1.7.2.2. Con: Having more budget is useless without the capacity to mobilise it.
1.7.2.3. Con: Any economic slow-down due to Brexit would reduce tax receipts for the government, restricting the country's budget and [reducing funding](https://www.ft.com/content/7658ec98-202f-11e7-b7d3-163f5a7f229c) for the NHS.
1.7.2.4. Con: The budget for the NHS could be increased or reduced regardless of our membership of the EU.
1.7.2.5. Pro: The UK prime minister has [claimed](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46350966) that the NHS budget would increase by Â£20bn by 2023.
1.7.2.6. Pro: Post Brexit, the UK will be able to pump in [Â£394 million](https://fullfact.org/health/nhs-england-394-million-more/) more a week into the National Health Service.
1.7.2.7. Con: The promise of Â£350M to NHS is just not true.
1.7.2.7.1. Pro: There is no evidence that any saved money \(if any even exists\) is going toward a budget for the NHS.
1.7.2.7.2. Pro: While that was a major campaign pledge, Farage & Johnson both quickly [backpedalled](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/nigel-farage-350-million-pledge-to-fund-the-nhs-was-a-mistake/) after 'winning' and said it was not something they could promise.
1.7.2.7.3. Pro: Devaluation of the pound is already set to increase costs for the NHS by [more than double](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Brexit-and-the-NHS-.pdf) the entire Â£350m/week that "could" have gone to the NHS.
1.7.2.7.4. Con: The famous bus did not claim that Â£350m would go to the NHS. It said: "We send the EU Â£350 a week. Let's fund the NHS instead". This conveyed that we could use our EU contributions to increase funding to the NHS and other similar good causes, not that all savings would go directly to the NHS. Remember - it was a slogan written on the side of a bus; there was no room for a detailed, comprehensive spending plan for the Â£350 million.
1.7.2.7.4.1. Con: The UK [does not spend](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) Â£350 million/week on the EU, so that figure is not available to spend on the NHS, or anywhere else.
1.7.2.7.4.2. Con: Leave campaigners did not begin claiming this statement as merely something they "could" do until after the referendum result was announced. Had they done so before they may well have lost.
1.7.3. Con: If the UK does not replicate and effectively enforce the equivalent of EU directives related to health and wellbeing while other standards decline, the NHS will have to spend more money tackling poor health.
1.7.3.1. Con: We will be able to set rules such that "self inflicted" illnesses are not eligible for NHS aid.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Poor health is [often linked](https://www.healthpovertyaction.org/news-events/key-facts-poverty-and-poor-health/) to poverty, which nobody chooses to be born into.
1.7.4. Con: A lot of the jobs that the British people don't want to do in hospitals have to be done by others, usually EU immigrants. By reducing the freedom of movement, the NHS will receive fewer doctors, nurses and surgeons from EU countries who have the qualifications to contribute to our healthcare system.
1.7.4.1. Con: Reducing supply of nurses and doctors from the EU will be an opportunity to train own people into these occupations. By reducing immigration [\(82% population growth recently caused by immigration\)](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6088861/Migration-82-UKs-population-growth.html) we will also reduce growth of the demand for health service.
1.7.4.2. Con: Ending of freedom of movement from EU will allow capacity for skilled immigration from non-EU countries. This could mean more skilled medical staff from non-EU countries, without diminishing number of EU staff.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Freedom of movement enables healthcare professionals to gain [experience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851015002146) working in other European countries. The result is a cross-pollination of ideas and skills, resulting in better ways of working. It also facilitates collaboration in medical research projects.
1.7.4.4. Pro: Much of any "increased budget" will have to be put towards recruiting and training staff and hiring more expensive agency staff to [replace EU workers](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-could-cost-nhs-visas_uk_5b8ec7cde4b0511db3dcc4aa).
1.7.4.4.1. Con: Cheaper workers can be hired from further afield than the EU. They won't need training because we can set our immigration rules to only allow qualified immigrants.
1.7.5. Con: Many people with [actual working knowledge](https://www.nhsconfed.org/regions-and-eu/nhs-european-office/brexit-and-the-nhs) of the NHS have said unambiguously that we can have Brexit or the NHS, but not both. Usually people claiming a successful outcome have links to private healthcare providers.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Even [those](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-nhs-might-have-to-be-replaced-by-private-health-insurance-9988904.html) with no knowledge of the NHS are working on the basis of Brexit or the NHS.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.9. Con: The UK has faced political and parliamentary divisions as a result of Brexit.
1.9.1. Pro: Brexit has uncovered deep seated divisions in and across the country and between the people and Parliament. The fears, hatred and xenophobia generated by some campaign leaders and the media will not quietly go away and leave Britain a united community.
1.9.1.1. Con: It is better that these divisions are out in the open where they can be dealt with, especially in respect of the division between parliament and the people. If that one is [dealt with](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/237424), then the other divisions will very likely be substantially diminished.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: It would be better still if the [activities](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-investigate-law-breaking-influence-manipulation-theresa-may-facebook-a8783746.html) generating fear, hatred and xenophobia were out in the open so they could be dealt with.
