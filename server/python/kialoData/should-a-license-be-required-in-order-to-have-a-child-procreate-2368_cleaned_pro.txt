A licensing system controlling procreation would enable the government to direct human evolution towards positive eugenic ends.	The practicalities of implementing such a policy would make it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to implement in some countries.	Parenting licenses will bring undue harm to people.	It would be fair towards people who \(have to\) adopt to make the procedure to choose for procreation equally complex.	A parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.	It is the duty of the state to maximize the quality of life of all its people.	Parenting licenses allow for earlier state intervention than current child protection processes. This is in the best interest of both child and parent\(s\), as well as society.

A right can't inflict harm. A right to be an irresponsible parent inflicts harms on children. It is therefore the duty of the government to minimise the number of irresponsible parents.	pro	There is no "right to be an irresponsible parent". There is a right to be a parent and parents are then free to raise their children as they see fit assuming they follow the law. The specific right to be a parent does not itself inflict the harm on the children, the parents do. Basically, if we hold that it is the rights that inflict harm then the logical extension of this would be complete totalitarianism.	Taking children from their families, as a licensing scheme would ultimately cause, also inflicts damage to them and there would likely be a large number of children taken for petty bureaucratic reasons. A policy like this would inflict more harm than it prevents.	In the US, one could use their right to bear arms to intimidate someone, without it undermining their rights.

Rights are not absolute and in some cases end up competing against each other.	pro	Effective government action restricts some liberty in one area to allow greater liberty in another.	Unconceived future children, either as specific intended children or as future generations, have no current ontological status and thus no current interests or rights.

The bodily autonomy of the parent comes at the expense of the bodily authority of the child. The purpose of the test is to limit the autonomy of the parents if it is deemed as harmful towards their unborn children.	Rights must be absolute, otherwise they are convenience and must be universally applicable, otherwise they are privileges.	Where they clash, children's rights should overrule parents' rights.	The potential harm to the child cannot be measured with absolute accuracy. In fact, it is impossible to determine if the rights of the child will be harmed at all, even if the parents fail to get the license. However, the harm to the parents is clear and fully realized. Therefore we should preference their rights.	Framing the claim to a right to procreate in a model of competing rights leads to a circular argument in which a nonexistent child could claim a right to prevent its own existence.	The right to procreation is matched by the [right](https://www.unicef.org/crc/files/Protection_list.pdf) of a future child to be safe.

A public licensing body would be subject to the whims of the ruling party or the various opinions and standpoints of the ruling elite.	This is likely to lead to the homogenisation of society, as only those that fit a specific profile will be able to reproduce.	The idea of "positive ends" is subjective and therefore irrational. There is no institution that has the right to decide that certain humans are worthy of carrying genes forward and others are not. History proves this is a dangerously oppressive power to grant any human institution.

As such, society has no right to make a parent's decision on whether or not to have a child with hereditary disorders, or indeed that child's right to exist.	The very fact that someone is willing to invoke eugenics as a positive outcome here is evidence to support exactly how it will be misused and should be avoided at all costs.	A licensing system should prevent the procreation of people with severe hereditary disorders, which it could do by requiring prospective biological parents to pass a basic physical health standard in order to be allowed to procreate.

a parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.	0_1.6.	A parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.	pro	A parenting license incentivises people to cover up or lie about their flaws, rather than seeking help.	If overall parenting improves, the drain on state resources is likely to decrease, resulting in better child services for those children still at risk.	The government-preferred parenting is not necessarily better parenting. Centralized solutions decided by governments are rarely better for individuals who do not fit the norms.	A form of a parenting licence system to dictate number of births has already been used in China. China is the only country with a suicide rate [higher](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-statistics.html) for females than males. This should raise questions regarding the impact of imposed fertility control on female mental health.	A parenting license encourages responsible family planning.	All parenting licenses can guarantee is short term, superficial changes in a person's lifestyle or parenting choices. This is not enough to make meaningful long-term change in their child's wellbeing.	A parenting license system will create clear, state-sanctioned guidance on what comprises good parenting.	Bad parenting results in harmful consequences for the child. Requiring a parent to obtain a license ensures a basic standard of parenting.	There is evidence from examining occupational licensing that increased licensing does not necessarily lead to higher quality. For example, one study found that occupational licensing of dentists did not lead to improved measured dental outcomes of patients \([p. 176](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217642001.pdf)(...the Rasmuson Founda-tion, and the Bethel Community Services Foundation showed that dental hygienists did as well as dentists in performing routine tasks such as the ones listed here \(Wetterhall et al. 2010\).)\).

Current child protection services are reactive rather than proactive and wait until the parents neglect or harm their children before taking action. Parenting licenses mitigate that harm.	Forcing children into state custody is simply not possible. The foster care system throughout the USA is already overcrowded \([nearly half a million children](http://www.childrensrights.org/newsroom/fact-sheets/foster-care/)\)and many children \(20,000 in 2015 alone\) remaining "in the system" until they "age out" at 18.	Community parenting licenses would allow communities to gather and license the resources necessary for supporting parents and children.	The act of parenting itself can change a person for the better. A parenting license would take that chance away from a person because of their present condition without taking into account that parenting could inspire them to do better.	A license is only able to screen people beforehand, not act as an intervention agent after a person has a license. Rather than preventing abuse, it simply prevents able prospective parents from procreating.	Under the status quo, abuse or neglect of infants or very young children often goes undetected.	If a child is to be removed from their family, it is best to do that when they are an infant.

Since it is impossible to prohibit someone to have a child, in the case of parent license, the state would need to get the child and take care of her. So, the taxpayers would pay for this.
