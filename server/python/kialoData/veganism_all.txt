Veganism promotes empathy.	Vegan industries are often more transparent and supportive of workers' rights than their non-vegan counterparts.	Veganism is not as ethical as other lifestyles.	At present, human demand for meat outweighs our ethical concerns surrounding the eating of meat.

Killing animals for food is a [survival instinct](http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43484), and so not inherently unethical or morally blameworthy.	Unlike many examples of immoral behaviour such as homicide, whether eating meat constitutes an immoral act is not widely agreed-upon. In such cases where a consensus opinion is lacking, it seems questionable that arbitrary moral standards should be applied.	Because a vegan world would have less violence and cruelty than our world today where animals are killed and eaten, the [knock-on effects](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/knock-on%20effect) are something inconceivable to us currently. The possibilities for future moral benefits are virtually endless.	A [vegan approach](http://www.vegansociety.com) to the world tends to support the rights of humans, as well as benefiting animals.	The morals would not be justified if it comes at a cost or conflict with other important or grander values or people \(lives, societies, etc.\).	Some aspects of veganism involve racism. Racism could potentially get worse, through veganism, if implemented fully.

Thus, it can be redefined \(just like the word 'organic'\) by others to solidify the concept.

A vegan society would cause the least harm to wildlife.	pro	Since people eat more varieties of plants on a vegan diet than an omnivorous one, people can learn about, appreciate, and have a desire to protect biodiversity more.	In a vegan world, species would not be as endangered anymore, some species would not go extinct.	Consuming plants, in fact, can sometimes lead to man-animal conflict.	[Monocrop](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/environmental/monoculture-gardening.htm) agriculture to service vegan demand is an environmental catastrophe.	The [fishing industry is especially deleterious to the ocean's biota](http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6400/readings/Dayton_et_al._1995.pdf).	In addition to being not harmful, vegan foods can be very symbiotic with and beneficial to wildlife.	Infrastructure could be made more vegan. Efforts made by the [Boring Company](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/) to make car traffic go underground could reduce injuries to wildlife on Earth's surface.	Hunting for population control is better for the ecosystem and creates more protections for such species and populations than the vegan approach of not harming animals.	Pets \(like [cats](http://www.thegardenisland.com/2018/03/18/hawaii-news/feral-cats-make-invasive-species-list/) and [fish](http://www.saltwatersmarts.com/why-never-release-marine-aquarium-livestock-into-wild-2792/)\) can cause damage to the environment \(especially wildlife\) by becoming invasive. Not having them would decrease this issue.	A vegan society may not last in the long-term. Between when they start and end, they may remove all animal agriculture. So if the majority of people decide to not be vegan again, without livestock available, people may resort to eating wildlife, when they normally do not.	The risk of [death of wildlife](https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/viewhtml.php?id=281) increases during the transport of food, especially when the vegan food travels for thousands of miles by land. Local meat would cause less harm to wildlife during its transport.	If people eat [lake-grown algae](http://www.klamathafa.com/afa.html) for example, they are eating more lives in one bite than how many are lost to make a steak.

People can eat whatever they want as long as it does no harm	The idea of framing veganism as a natural right is to characterise service providers failing to offer vegan options as violating rights, not merely a right to procure vegan food without any impositions on others. Positive rights such as that do not exist.	Veganism is not necessary for survival and humans did not evolve to be vegan naturally. This makes veganism a choice unnecessary for survival. Therefore Veganism is an artificial ideology, not a natural right.	[Conscious creatures](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201801/animal-consciousness-new-report-puts-all-doubts-sleep) have Natural Rights corresponding to their potential to need them. Among the greatest of those rights is the right to not be abused or deprived of life. A human is therefore naturally entitled \(and morally obligated\) to make choices to respect animals' natural rights while procuring provisions to sustain their own life \(eg: food, shelter, warmth\).	The vegan lifestyle is sufficient to sustain human life. When compared to a non-vegan lifestyle, a vegan lifestyle does less harm to other species and results in a lesser sum of harms against other species. Therefore, veganism is a more basic level of lifestyle for survival than non-veganism, and non-vegans are essentially choosing to augment that basic lifestyle with non-vegan furnishings.	Humans sit in the greatest position of control on earth, to rule it and shape it as though the highest power in it. Since we are considering that inalienable rights are endowed by natural law, we must be inferring that there is a natural preference for how justice is shaped. Nature, \(particularly the expression of life\), is most at [peace](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/peace) when ruled in [fairness](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fair), so it follows that natural law should direct humans to be [benevolent](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/benevolent). Humans are meant to be vegan.	If someone is vegan for health reasons \(like being allergic to animal products\), then it's an inalienable right for them to be vegan.

If that actually were the case, people wouldn't be eating meat.	If it were the case that non-meat products were universally as good as meat, then vegetarians would not try, and also not to such a degree fail, to replicate the taste of meat.	Meat imitation products are expensive and are not a viable option for low-income individuals and families.	Faux meats are getting better over time as more people demand it. With more demand fake meats will taste better.	The very knowledge that one is eating an animal is pleasurable to many people and cannot be imitated with non-animal products. Certain meats carry status in many cultures, such as beef in the US.	[Artificial meat](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/artificial-chicken-grown-cells-gets-taste-test-who-will-regulate-it), which imitates the taste of real meat but is lab-grown, is being developed and could replace the taste experiences of real meat without the harm caused to animals, and with significantly less environmental consequences.	Vegetarian food offers more choices when meat is taken off the food plate. Usually there are small number of meat choices \(mostly chicken or beef with the occasional turkey, fish, and seafood\). The substitutions for this are numerous, from extra sides to faux meats.	In fact, meat itself has little to no taste, it's the texture it has and spices and flavors we add to it that makes it delicious. Other textured proteins like soy can have the same delicious taste and be almost unrecognizable.	Taste is an acquired habit. Some cultures that eat dogs, snakes, rabbits, snails etc. also do it because they acquired those tastes even though in other cultures eating one or more of those animals is considered disgusting. Same is with vegan food. There are several cultures that promote vegetarianism and of late veganism has also grown significantly. Also, all spices and flavorful ingredients added to food to enrich taste, like pepper, chilies, garlic, ginger, basil etc are all in fact, plants.	Eating is pleasurable in general. Finding more pleasure in one food type than in another is subjective and largely determined by personal experience with recepies and cooking, family traditions, memories, habits of one's environment, etc.	Stopping eating meat just means dropping a few ingredients. There are lots and lots of ingredients left to use and be creative with.

Popularity and pleasure has no relevance to what is right or wrong.	pro	Most people live in this common situation : where the satisfaction of most of our basic needs is already distorted, where sleep is sacrificed to save time, where amusement is seen as a waste of productivity, where having hobbies gives a sense of guilt about not using the time and money for more "important" things, where human relations are an open war for understanding, stability and social recognition \(...\) In such society, eating is the last basic need we can still take pleasure satisfying.	Concepts of right and wrong are formed by societies, and thus decided by popularity.	As people decide what choices are "right" or "wrong" based on how the choices serve the end goals they happen to value--be those goals the raising the quality of life of the world as a whole, just that of humans, or making more money as an individual--and those goals may not be shared by all of one's population, right and wrong are in fact concepts isolated from popular opinion.	Some ethical systems are built upon the concept of pleasure as the highest good, \(hedonic morality\), so pleasure does indeed factor into judgments of right and wrong for the many subscribing to such notions, i.e., meat eaters who hold their preferences in higher regard than the suffering of others.	If popularity or pleasure had any relevance, we would never abolish slavery and could use that to justify any form of exploitation.	It is not morally justifiable to value one's own taste over an animal's life.	Both popularity and pleasure are relevant to "right and wrong", or the concerns of ethics and morality. They certainly do not equate to morality on a one to one basis, not are they interchangeable with ethics or morality, but they are entirely relevant. Nearly every attempt at a cohesive system of ethics must take into account what is pleasurable to the individual and the larger society as well as the beliefs held by the majority of the population.	As the vegetarian diet can satisfy our nutritional needs, eating meat only to satisfy our taste buds is incompatible with a moral or ethical being.	"no relevance" is too strong. Taking away a preference for no good reason is wrong. "little relevance" would be more precise, as other common ethical concerned associated with eating meat trump personal pleasures.

It is not the decision of one person what another puts into their bodies.	This argument is based off an internally judged moral system. None of the claims have hard fact behind them. Confidence brings verisimilitude but has no effect on actual truth. Proper justification is based on reality not personal preference.	Such an act is justifiable from a hedonistic standpoint.	Plants are living as well and yet nobody seems to have a problem with harvesting them for consumption.	This has less to do with right and wrong, and more to do with justice. Is it just for humans to consume the flesh of other species when it is on longer necessary? There have been times in our history when it was necessary, but this is no longer the case, so a more relevant question would be 'should it be considered torture and murder to kill sentient beings when it is not a necessity?' If not, why? Why is it ok to kill animals who think and feel, when it is not necessary?	It is natural to eat whatever is convenient, even if it is not strictly necessary for survival. Bears, for example, are omnivores yet eat meat whenever [the opportunity arises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear#Behaviour).

There is no inherent difference between animals and humans; to insist otherwise is [speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism), the act of discriminating against a being on the basis of their species.	Humans are superior to all other animals, because they have the ability to make choices based on morality, and not instinct. It's what separates us from all other life known life forms.	Following that logic, animals are not superior to any other life form, they are simply a small part of a whole ecosystem. As such they have no legitimate right to kill other life forms as they please. This is inherently problematic.	The concept of "rights" is a creation of rational beings living in a society. The idea of "rights" seeks to transcend ecosystems and the "state of nature". If we are considering humans and other animals in their natural context of a state of nature in an ecosystem, then introducing rights is an inappropriate and anachronistic interjection.	When we look at it biologically, assigning less value to animals is a form of discrimination. It's just discrimination based on more features than within-species discrimination \(e.g. different anatomical structures or less intelligence instead of just the color of the skin\).

The normalizing of killing animals for food leads to a close-minded population less able to feel empathy and emotions for other species.	The uniqueness of humanity lies in its ability to reason beyond the forces of entropy and past the constraints of an impulse for survival. Humanity has for the most part conquered survival, and we continue to conquer the vices with which we were born as we progress towards something of a species to be proud of. We must undo these obsolete desires for pleasure as they come at the cost of life. It is in our power, our moral beliefs, and our logical perspective of life as humans to do so.	Our sapience necessitates moral standard.  A similar argument can be made against homosexuality. The naturalness or temptation of an act does not immediately award permission.	The wholesale slaughter of sentient non-human animals demonstrates that violence is an acceptable human behaviour.	Morality is wholly subjective, this argument presupposes an absolute moral authority counter to popular opinion. Indeed even if we were to follow the prevailing democratic subjective morality, the vast majority regularly eat meat. The idea that killing animals for food or eating meat is 'immoral' one can assume is an opinion held by [less than 10% of the global population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country) with not a single major territory where it is the prevailing norm.	The assumption that animals are not morally conscious is just that— an assumption. Prove it.	The more we learn about other animals, especially mammals, the more we learn they're intelligent, feeling beings. It is therefore morally and ethically wrong to continue farming and killing animals, and eating their meat, due to the suffering we cause them \(parent-child separation, cramped conditions, etc\).	We instinctively feel compassion towards animals, while carnivorous animals instinctively try to kill weaker species. E.g. Put a toddler and a rabbit in a crib, \(s\)he will hug it; put a lion cub and a rabbit in a crib, it will try to eat it.	Empathise with animals - how would you feel if your children were taken from you, fattened and then slaughtered for the purposes of feeding another beast. Or if you were herded into an abattoir where the friends you graze with are stunned and killed before you as you wait your turn. Cattle and pigs are mammals like us and experience the world through emotions not dissimilar to our own.	Abstaining from animal meat consumption allows one to reflect on more compassionate views of the world, and human involvement as caretakers of the ecology.	Morality is not absolute. While vegetarianism is a sign of moral virtue for [some Buddhists](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=RNBgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=buddhism+moral+vegetarianism&source=bl&ots=sdH97MDzta&sig=LZsKluIQOJ5QPhboqstbQTlePRA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp_7aBzoPNAhXmYaYKHQtDAQcQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=buddhism%20moral%20vegetarianism&f=false), eating meat has equally been interpreted as a [moral duty](http://animalethics.blogspot.kr/2011/06/roger-scruton-on-duty-to-eat-meat.html).

eating and producing meat heavily contributes to climate change.	3_1.1.4.8.1.1.9.2.1.1.7.1.6.1.	Eating and producing meat heavily contributes to climate change.	pro	The [meat](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet) lover's diet has the worst carbon footprint: about double the amount of a vegan diet.	[Livestock](http://www.worldwatch.org/global-meat-production-and-consumption-continue-rise-1) account for an estimated 18% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, producing 40% of the world’s methane and 65% of the world’s nitrous oxide.	Any major industry heavily contributes to climate change. This is not particular to meat production.	This does not make eating meat inherently wrong, because the massive scale of our population is the main cause of the massive scale of farming and therefore also the massive scale of green house gas emissions.	Farming meat has a disproportionate impact on the climate, contributing as many or more greenhouse gases than well-known polluters like cars and other industries.	Producing meat heavily contributes to climate change. Eating meat does not contribute to climate change. Even if it is true that humans should stop producing meat, it does not follow that humans should stop eating meat \(eg. from a hunted wild animal\).	It is critical to address climate change in order to prevent drastic effects \(up to and including mass extinctions\) on both humans and all other forms of life.	While meat production does entail production of [up to 9%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) of the world's greenhouse gases, the source of the carbon is less problematic than the other 91% of the carbon, mostly produced by fossil fuels. Cows belch methane, but this carbon originates from the atmosphere and goes back into the atmosphere in climate-boosted form. Fossil fuels take carbon formerly sequestered deep underground, and adds it to the atmosphere. So meat is problematic, but not in the same league as fossil fuel.	22% of meat [ends up in landfills in U.S, Canada, Australia, & New Zealand, collectively](https://www.savethefood.com). Meat in landfills [releases methane, which is 35x as potent in Global Warming Potential as carbon dioxide](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials) over the span of a century.	Meat's transport and storage requirements consume more resources and generate more emissions than for vegetables.	Focusing on the gasses released by live stock alone doesn't take into account the huge swathes of forest which are destroyed not only to house these animals, but also to grow feed. These forests are burned which releases large amounts of C02 and also takes away one of the best natural converters of carbon dioxide to oxygen. Feeding humanity with plants would require significantly less land use.	Producing meat only has a substantial impact on Carbon Dioxide and methane emissions. There are greenhouse gases with 32,000 times the Greenhouse Warming Potential \(GWP\) of CO2 and 4,289 times the GWP of Methane. Other greenhouse gases should be our priority as carbon emissions are reversible if re-forestation and re-greening efforts are made. [ghginstitute.org](http://ghginstitute.org/2010/06/28/what-is-a-global-warming-potential/)	The fact that meat eating and production contributes to climate change is not an argument for complete abstention from eating meat, it is only an argument for reducing the impact of meat eating, either through reduction in per capital amounts eaten or more sustainable farming practices.	The net effects of climate change are not obviously bad. There's no reason to believe the climate is perfectly optimized the way it is.	1 kg of chicken produces 6,9 kg CO2 eq; 1 kg of vegetables about 1.5-2 kg CO2 eq \([www.greeneatz.com](http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html)\). However, chicken has about 3-5 times more calories and up to 10 times as much protein as many vegetables, meaning you need to consume less of it on a kg to kg basis. A single mile in an airplane produces about 24 kg CO2 eq \([blueskymodel.org](http://blueskymodel.org/air-mile)\), about the same as 2 pounds of beef - so one single domestic flight will usually offset a person's meat-related carbon emissions for a whole year.	If humans stopped producing meat, the livestock would not simply disappear overnight and many of the animals could return to nature and reproduce.	Livestock-born GHG emissions have mostly been interpreted isolated from their ecosystemic context, ignoring their negligible significance within the global balance. There is no [scientific evidence](https://www.intechopen.com/books/forage-groups/domestic-livestock-and-its-alleged-role-in-climate-change), whatsoever, that domestic livestock could represent a risk for the Earth’s climate.

Eating a plant-rich diet ranks as the [fourth-most effective way](http://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank) to combat climate change.

Good livestock husbandry can actually heal and protect land.	Transforming into a vegan diet may do very little to reduce climate change as business organisations may simply create artificial products for human consumption that may re-enforce the issue of greenhouse gasses and pollution thereby re-enforcing the issue of climate change rather than ending it and further adding to the poor diet in humans	The same source \(now down, reup here: [www.mdpi.com](http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/9/1550/s1)\) also shows that beef makes the biggest difference.

What is natural can be derived.

We don't have the sharp teeth, claws or short intestinal track of carnivores.

Humans, like herbivores, lack the sharp [claws](http://www.celestialhealing.net/physicalveg3.htm) of a carnivorous predator, used to hunt down and kill prey.	While correct, this observation does not imply a prescription. Humans do not restrict themselves to activities that their bodies are optimized to do, but rather perform a whole range of activities, that the human body is not naturally meant for.	Humans aren't very successful at eating vegetables either \(as compare to, say, a cow\). These are the pains of being omnivores, and mean that humans cannot concentrate on only one kind of food. Thus, meat is an essential part of our diet. See [www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html).	Human's digestive system is designed to eat meat therefore eating meat is fundamental to good health.

Adaptation to new circumstances and opportunities is a hallmark of evolution, and thus nature in action. A changing diet that overcomes the physical adaptation to a previous diet is thus natural.

Human trafficking also brings many people pleasure; however, it is morally reprehensible because the pleasure comes at a horrific cost. Eating meat merely because it is pleasurable is not a strong pro meat consumption argument.	pro	The value of human life comes from a mutual agreeement to not kill each other, despite the uncomfortable ways that some humans may get pleasure from this practice. However, animals cannot make such agreements since to them, we can always be reduced to being either threats or just plain food. Therefore, there is no harm in getting pleasure from the meat acquired through the killing of an animal since it's the closest we can get to a mutual agreement.	Eating meat is not analogous to human trafficking, except on that one minor point.	According to utilitarianism the cost of human trafficking outweighs the good it creates which makes it morally reprehensible. The pleasure of eating meat does not come at the same horrific cost of human trafficking and therefore the overall utility to society is increased which makes eating meat a moral act.	Human trafficking brings no pleasure to anyone other than those with psychological damage who enjoy human suffering or those who deliberately ignore the cost of the trade to reap the dubious benefits. Neither of these groups are a majority and are certainly nowhere near the same size as those who enjoy meat.	Animals have no conscious awareness of their own death and are thus unaffected by the same human fear and dread experienced by slaves or others being trafficked for other reasons. Animals have little concept of freedom and it's opposite: oppression. Horror is a conscious, thinking reaction of humans and one not shared by any but the most intelligent animals which, as a result, we do not farm.

If we accept that humans are capable of greater emotions, then it isn't far-fetched to think that humans gain more from eating meat than animals lose from dying.	Suffering is not a necessity in the process by any means.

farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.	3_1.2.2.	Farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.	pro	Many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. Demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.	A 2012 study, examining the impact of a typical week’s eating, showed that plant-based diets are [better for the environment](https://www.vegsoc.org/eatingsustainably) than those based on meat.	Livestock have severe effects on their immediate environment, causing issues such as  [overgrazing, compaction, and erosion](http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html).	The production of meat consumes disproportionately more resources than the production of crops.	The vast amount of land required for animal agriculture leads to greater amounts of habitat loss.	There are many things that people do that have negative impacts on the environment which we would not want to complete stop doing.  For example, farming plants and trees, mining for construction, manufacturing of consumer electronics, etc. The negative impacts on the environment of farming animals is not a sufficient reason for the contention that all meat consumption should stop.	Many farm animals don't have their own native, wild habitat, and removing them from their farm habitat, by releasing them into the wild would very likely result in severe environmental, and ecological disruption. Many of these livestock would likely fail to survive in the wild, and others would likely displace existing species of plants and animals.	Many approaches to farming plants leads to monocultural agriculture practices that have a harmful impact on the wider environment.	There is no moral imperative for the environment to remain in stasis or for us regard it as 'fundamentally' in need of preserving so. Heat death awaits the entire universe.	In many cases land is best suited \(or only suited\) to farming meat; meaning that converting it to crops would be less efficient and thus cause greater environmental harms.	Plants can be grown in vertical farms, whereas animals cannot right now. Vertical farms use significantly less land through stacking.	Vegan foods offer little waste at the end since all of it could be turned to compost. This contrasts with the by-products of meat \(organs, fat, and bones\) that need to be re-purposed \(such as pet food\) for them not to get thrown away.	Eating meat causes human suffering, particularly in poor communities. Health problems in communities living near to animal agriculture operations and psychological problems in abbatoir workers.	Current industrialized fishing is responsable for getting many species of fish and other sea animals near extinction if not extinct already, which is detrimental to ocean's ecosystem.	If the impact is local, then the decision to prohibit meat eating and/or production should be local. This argument is relevant only to local policy and has no bearing on the absolute morality of meat eating and production.	Avoiding eating animals will help global bio-diversity in a big way. No longer will the planet be saturated with a few breeds of cows, chickens etc.	Regenerative livestock farmers worldwide are responsible for rehabilitating enormous tracts of land and in some cases helping bring at risk species of wildlife back into areas. I'm yet to see many grain and veg farmers to have a similar awareness.

The production of meat consumes disproportionately more resources than the production of crops.	pro	[77%](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/chart-shows-worlds-land-used/) of the worlds agricultural land is given over to livestock production.	Meat production will always be less calorie-efficient than vegetarian food production, since grain must be produced to feed meat animals.	While the practices of meat production in high-income industrialised countries tend to be resource inefficient, meat production in other countries is [a lot more efficient](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/09/03/it-does-not-take-7-kg-of-grain-to-make-1-kg-of-beef-be-very-careful-with-your-statistics/#1fc7709d5f0d). Rather than ceasing production altogether, we should ban inefficient methods of production.	A lot of the world's crops are currently used for animal feed, rather than human consumption.	Irrigation systems channel a catchment's water to agricultural uses rather than lead it follow it's natural path over a landscape. This deprives natural water ways and landscapes of their water supply and degrades local ecosystems.	Agricultural use of water disrupts the water table equilibrium and leads to [desertification](https://www.greenfacts.org/en/desertification/l-2/4-causes-desertification.htm) and [salinification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity_in_Australia).	It takes [100,000](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) liters of water to produce one kilogram of grain-fed beef.	[It takes](https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/12/livestock) two kg of grain to produce one kg of chicken, and between five and twenty kg of grain to produce one pound of beef.	There are countries where 99.9% of farming is grass fed. Industrial farming need not rely on grain - the nutrients are better, and the animals happier if you don't. Free range. Ethical farming practices would have one trying to replicate natural conditions. IMO, the same applies to agriculture, and recreating ecoystems/permaculture. We shouldn't I think, aim for the cheapest system - we should aim for the best system, to live on the earth, like we intend to stay here.	Trophic levels are important to consider here. As plants are consumed to feed an animal only ~10% of the energy is available for the animal. In other words, a strictly meat only diet would require 10 times the plant matter; 100 times if eating a predator.	Meat is inefficient. In growing animals for meat consumption the animal will always consume a significantly larger energy content in plant matter than can be obtained from the meat of that animal \(less than 5%\). This is due to the animal wasting massive quantities of energy in heating, digestion and movement.	The demand for, and pollution of, water resources from farming animals is immense.	Energy obtained from meat is second hand energy. It was first processed through a plant that was eaten after. And in each level of the chain some of the energy is dissipated.	Meat production uses twice as much land, water, and feed to produce the same amount of [calorie intake](https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/12/livestock) as other foods.	The amount of crops \(soy, corn, others\) that is fed to farm animals could feed more people if directly fed to humans. Therefore, meat aggravates world hunger and veganism can contribute to [ending world hunger](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cutting-back-on-meat-consumption-could-help-end-hunger-by-2030-experts_us_55f3424ee4b077ca094f27a5).	Animals are able to produce calories from kinds of plants and organic matter that humans cannot. Plants also do not rely on the seasons to live, breed, or be harvested thus creating for a more stable food source.	According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN \(FAO\), 60% of the world’s agricultural land is used for grazing livestock and 1/4 of the world’s croplands is used for animal feed. In total, 2/3 of the world’s agricultural area and 1/3 of the total global land area is used for [maintaining livestock](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2008/f/factory_farming_and_the_environment_1999.pdf).

How the animals are raised does not affect the conversion ratio of organisms on different trophic levels, but it does have an impact on the overall efficiency on a farm. The claim that animals == inefficiency is a zero-sum outlook on farm production, which only holds true for certain kinds of agriculture. In systems-based agriculture an animal is one part of the system, using inputs \(e.g. grass\), but creating inputs for other parts of the system \(e.g. manure\). This can be highly efficient.	We measure those conversation ratios [by burning the material](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/) in question and measuring the heat outputs.

the common practices underlying the production of meat \(massive livestock farming\) are unethical.	3_1.3.1.4.1.2.	The common practices underlying the production of meat \(massive livestock farming\) are unethical.	pro	Many animals raised for food are not slaughtered or kept humanely.	Because egg and meat production are separated by modern production practices the males of egg-laying chickens are often [shredded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) shortly after hatching as they are not needed.	Raising animals in confinement, deprived of sunlight, natural soil and freedom to move, is cruel and against their nature.	Consuming meat from organic livestock farming could help to mitigate these risks.	Animals on farms are routinely [mutilated with no anesthetic.](http://freefromharm.org/animal-products-and-ethics/a-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-humane-farming-myth/) The animals are castrated, given nose rings and ear tags, dehorned and debeaked, all of which are painful exercises carried out on most farms.	Cows have been seen to have incredibly strong bonds, particularly between mothers and their calves. On these farms the calves are often taken away from the mother to be killed and there are numerous reports of [mother cows calling and searching](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/factory-farming/cows/hidden-lives-cows/) for their babies.	Unnatural methods of farming could be easily curbed if industrial nations consumed less meat. Everyone being on a meatless diet is not necessary.	Cruel practices and incidents of animal abuse have been repeatedly exposed in animal agriculture. The true incidence is probably greater than those shown up through investigation.	Stressed out livestock will produce lower quality meat and less of it. It is in farmers' best interests to make sure their livestock are comfortable and safe.	Many meat producing companies use misleading titles like "Cage Free" and "Free Range" to make buyers feel better. Meanwhile instead of having individual cages that barely allow for movement, animals are crammed into huge pens where they often are so close that they bump into each other constantly. Either way you put it, it is inhumane and unnecessary to continue this practice for the sake of enjoying the taste.	Unethical common practices suggest more ethical practices exist, and thus this is an argument to change practices not halt farming of animals.	Animals in the slaughter chute that sense mortal danger feel fear—terror, in fact. That fear manifests as rushes of adrenaline and other biological processes may lock that fear into the meat that carnivore humans eat. According Jess Zimmerman, writing in Atlas Obscura, botched slaughtering of pigs—the pig survives the first attempt to kill it—causes less saleable, bad-tasting, acidic “pale soft exudative” meat, i.e., pork from frightened animals. [Why Meat from Scared Animals Tastes Worse](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-scared-animals-taste-worse)	This claim depends on examples of treatment that is cruel.  Many of the examples of farming practices viewed as cruel serve a function that benefits the animal's well being.  For instance calves are separated from their mother at birth because we are able to prevent infections better while they increase antibodies, killing is necessary but pain free, animals are restrained, but in many cases are free to exhibit normal social behavior. Producers know that reducing stress increases output.

The [Humane Slaughter Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Slaughter_Act) in the US has been a federal law for over 60 years.

Parenthood problems could, therefore, be avoided by sedating and giving more "humane" treatment to animals.	This is a biological response rather than emotional. Mother cows udders become full of milk when the calf is removed, and the mother is looking for her calf simply for relief. The same is true of removed calves calling for their mothers for milk. Once the calves begin to eat solid food they stop searching for the mother, and once the mothers' milk production stops they stop searching for their calves. If there was an emotional response, we could assume some pairs would continue to search.

The idea that eating meat is less civilized than not eating meat is a subjective value judgement, which is neither sufficiently justified here, nor widely accepted.	Evolutionary speaking, hominids only had access to meat after coming down from the trees, which means eating meat came after eating fruits and vegetables, and is therefore more civilized. Moreover, eating meat required the invention of weapons to hunt, and the discovery of fire, furthering the correlation between meat and civilization.

buying and consuming processed meat from intensive livestock farming is anything but natural.	3_1.4.1.	Buying and consuming processed meat from intensive livestock farming is anything but natural.	pro	We may only talk of a 'natural' process when observing the ways of indigenous tribes such as the Inuit, who hunt and prepare their meat themselves, and do not over-consume or waste their prey. The majority of humankind today do not share these same, natural practices.	Raising animals in confinement, deprived of sunlight, natural soil and freedom to move, is cruel and against their nature.	Consuming meat from organic livestock farming could help to mitigate these risks.	Meat requires [preservatives](http://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/_Documents/industry/preservative_use_in_processed_meats.pdf) so it does not spoil.	Unnatural methods of farming could be easily curbed if industrial nations consumed less meat. Everyone being on a meatless diet is not necessary.	Chaffing male chickens right after their hatching is anything but natural.	By the same logic one could argue that vegetarianism through the consumption of milk produced and food grown on large-scale farms is anything but natural.	Carnivores have a place in the ecosystem, but the human practice of eating domestic meat does not satisfy the requirement of ecological benefit and therefore becomes harmful at scale.	The potential of human's progress has already been there from the very beginning, like the potential of a flower is already in its seed. So how humans live today is the real natural way, not the underdeveloped states before.

Therefore our ancestors were more gatherers than hunters.	pro	It might be easier to gather a plant, but it is not easier to plant than to hunt.

Hunting could potentially take minutes/hours, whereas farming involves constant attention over months.	From experience in the bush, it is easier and more efficient to get your daily needs for nutrition by hunting and eating animals than it is by gathering plants. Therefore I would argue that our ancestors met their caloric needs primarily through animal consumption.

Because animals feel, they should be treated according to [utilitarian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), which advocates maximising pleasure and minimising suffering for all sentient beings.	Animals from a wide range of species have been shown to experience [emotions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201306/universal-declaration-animal-sentience-no-pretending) including happiness, grief, empathy and jealousy.	Sentience is not a sufficient condition for having rights. For example, ants are sentient, but it would be unreasonable to say that they have a right to life.	We should grant rights to all sentient beings because there is no consistent way of differentiating between humans \(who have rights\) and other sentient beings.	Animals are sentient, but not rational, therefore cannot predict suffering or conceive their fates in slaughter houses. Rights emerge from the prediction of suffering.	Animals are not as self aware as humans, so they would not be aware of their coming death until it's already happened. Especially as the methods of doing so are quick and painless.	Non-human animals, just like humans, are sencient and have a conscience.

Thus, utilitarian ethics suggest that humans should keep eating meat.	Humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the sublimation of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner. Animals are not, thus they are unequal to humans on a moral level.	Act utilitarian [Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_%28book%29) argues that the Basic Principle of Equality should be extended to nonhuman animals and that it would demand us to equally consider the interests of animals.	Billions of animals are brutalized and tortured on factory farms every year. Since the only pleasure humans get from eating meat is gustatory pleasure, it is doubtful that the pain and suffering that these animals experience can ever be justified according to utilitarian principles.	Utilitarian ethics is not only a disputed way of thinking, but is very difficult to implement \(for instance, what is the appropriate time span of pain/pleasure that we are computing?\), especially in nature, which does not care about utilitarianism.	We are beginning to find evidence that [plants feel as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrrSAc-vjG4) If plants and animals both feel, we cannot afford to treat them both with utilitarian ethics, we have to eat something! Animals are not more deserving of care than plants. No matter what we do, we'll be making an ethical compromise and killing a living, feeling being.	Many animals are incapable of feeling pain. Depending on the definition of sentient this may not be able to be applied to meat from any source in general.	Farm [animals feel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness) pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are [sentient](http://www.livescience.com/39481-time-to-declare-animal-sentience.html) and intelligent beings, thus utilitarianism can be applied to them. \([psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201306/universal-declaration-animal-sentience-no-pretending)\)	A pleasure maximizing ethical paradigm might just as easily justify breeding livestock for food, raising them in a way that maximizes their happiness, and killing them in the most humane manner possible. By bringing a life into this world you are increasing total happiness and satisfying the tastes/preferences of humans who desire meat as food.	The argument has been made that plants are [equally sentient and intelligent](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/aug/04/plants-intelligent-sentient-book-brilliant-green-internet), even though not in the same sense as humans and animals are.

eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.	3_1.8.	Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.	pro	Farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.	Unlike other animals, humans are morally conscious of their behaviour and are thus subject to [moral standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality), meaning they cannot justify meat consumption on the basis of \(arguments such as\) convenience or their own mental superiority.	The common practices underlying the production of meat \(massive livestock farming\) are unethical.	All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.	For most people, eating meat is needless and the needless killing of beings with a will to live is immoral.	Conscious vegetarianism facilitates compassion towards other living beings and discourages us from viewing them as mere ingredients to a recipe.	Morality is subjective, so eating meat is not necessarily immoral.	Ceasing to eat meat would mean that vast quantities of livestock would die without being replaced as they are unable to survive effectively outside of human agriculture.	A great many human activities cause the deaths of animals. A focus on meat leads to moral inconsistency and potential hypocrisy.	Given that meat is still the primary food source for many people in less fortunate countries. Given that human bodies vary wildly in which foods they will process more efficiently. Given that some conditions will actually make eating plant only foods a negative life choice for many. It is cruel and immoral to presume that no human should eat meat under any circumstances. The above claim completely ignores the quality of life of other humans, making the claim itself cruel and immoral.	Eating meat is not immoral; the production of meat can be cruel but the consumption is not.	Consuming vegetables is also cruel to both the plants and to the workers responsible for the agricultural process.	If everyone who cares about the ethical treatment of animals were to stop eating meat, then the only people farming and consuming meat would be those who lack compassion for the animals. Human's relationship with nature should be one of mutual respect and compassion - this will never happen if those who would put this in practice choose instead to have no symbiotic relationship with nature at all.	While much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. Ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources \(i.e. free range farming\) that afford animals the same \(if not better\) quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.	We should not rely on other lives \(such as eating animals\) to progress our own. Finding a way to not depend on others for people's existence allows for independence. Then people will not feel compelled to resort to cruelty to survive.	The effects of this cruel treatment are twofold. Not only does it involve the suffering and murder of billions on an annual basis but also negatively impacts the environment \(methane and phosphorous outputs, deforestation\). Ultimately hurting non-domestic animal species and ourselves in the process	Take the flesh that the average meat eater consumes and make them take the action of the rearing and slaughtering of the life form behind that flesh, other than letting a fish suffocate most today would find themselves unable. A wrong they can not replicate if not delegated.	So many people are worried about animals but don't even think twice when walking by a homeless person on the streets. It's preposterous. How about we worry about our own kind first and then start talking about animals.	The statement is unclear as it is not specified what the "majority of cases" are. What delineates those from the others, supposedly not cruel or not immoral?	Moral values are typically pertinent to particular individuals, groups, religions or schools of thought. There are no universally accepted moral values that condemn eating meat or treating animals in any particular way. Therefore the statement that eating meat can involve immoral treatment, is false.	The ignorance and confusion about how animals are treated may have been deliberately caused by the meat industry [lack of transparency](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/09/magazine/meat-industry-transparency-fight.html) and [misleading advertising.](https://www.ecowatch.com/dairy-industry-facts-2525727633.html)	For those who eat meat, it may also mean that they neither have a developed empathy nor a developed compassion - leaving farm animals out of their [circles of compassion](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/28/einstein-circles-of-compassion/), or just that they don't have [reliable sources of information](https://www.viva.org.uk/blog/meat-myths). \(e.g. ["suicide food".](https://suicidefood.blogspot.com/)\)	Relating to the standards of good behaviour \(not killing / not imprisoning\), fairness \(not profiting on others pain / not imposing artificial insemination to females or robbing them their byproducts -eggs or milk\), and honesty \(not enslaving entire species -farm animals / not robbing other intelligent and sentient beings offspring to subdue them as well\), [i.e. morals](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/moral), eating meat is wrong, especially when there are [alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_meat_substitutes).

That study relies on a 'best case' farming practice that seeks to minimise animal deaths and protect crops through all stages of vegetable production. In almost all cases those practices are not followed in mainstream agriculture.	That study included, "animals slaughtered directly for food, and animals killed in the harvesting of crops... predators killed in defense of livestock, animals prevented from existing by the destruction of their habitat, and human deaths from food poisoning, disease, or accidents on farms or in slaughterhouses." It does not include intentionally killed pest animals, which would likely make a difference for both sources, especially if they included insects, which they did not.	While the study suggests fewer animals are harmed in production of vegetarian products, the authors themselves recognize limitations in their own study. They clearly state that no accurate estimates exist of how many animals are actually harmed due to farming practices.	The study talks about calories. Vegetables are more "calorie dense" \(as in calories/kg\) than meats. If we look at the numbers for protein production, the result would be the opposite, since meat is much more protein dense than vegetables. Calories alone are not sufficient for a healthy diet, and protein malnutrition can be fatal.	The study also does not take into account broader environmental impacts of plant agriculture like destruction of animal habitat for farmland, leaching of agricultural chemicals \(even fertilizer leaked into nearby areas like water source can cause negative impacts like increased algae growth which can choke out fish species\), and removal of insects which are often basal components of food webs of that area.	Animals per calorie is an absurd metric. 251.1 zooplankton are insignificant compared to 2.55 blue whales.	This is a severely misleading characterization of the study. A single cow provides far more than 1000 calories. A single pound of hamburger contains 1000 calories.

Red meat animals feed on pasture, which requires next to no upkeep. In contrast, farming vegetables requires the use of pesticides that kill massive amounts of insects and/or similar measures that kill birds.	Measuring against kg of usable protein is misleading, since meat has higher concentrations of proteins relative to other nutrients. So the gap between meat and grains is not that large.	99% of animals raised for red meat spend at least some of their lives on feedlots. The grains they are fed are just as responsible for killing sentient animals.	That article only refers to Australia where cattle spend significantly more time grazing in fields. That does not hold for animals in factory farms fed a diet from farmed plant products.	The article linked to is full of misinformation. Check the comments section for refutation of nearly every point. One point is the many mice being killed by harvest of grains, yet  "the only fields a mouse might be attracted to would be wheat or corn. Since both of those are harvested by machines which cut the stalks several inches above the ground. Any self respecting mouse would have no problem avoiding the harvester unless it is suicidal."	Modern urban farming using techniques such as [hydroponics](http://www.hortidaily.com/article/1177/900-crops-of-lettuce-per-square-meter,-and-only-4-laborers-per-hectare), aquaponics, and microfarming does not directly or indirectly harm animals, and yields far greater crop yields than traditional farming techniques.	This claim and the supporting article are very specific to beef cattle reared in Australia where pastoral lands are abundant. It doesn't hold when you consider the land required for free range animal rearing to satisfy the global appetite for meat.	This depends on the food. Hand-picked crops like strawberries and peas do not harm as many animals — if anything they support life because beneficial insects are brought to the farm to help the crops grow.

all animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.	3_1.8.4.	All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.	pro	Some animals, who due to their reproduction disturb a natural balance, need to be killed in order to preserve biodiversity. This is the case with rabbits on the German island [Norderney](http://de.alamy.com/stock-photo-rabbits-on-a-meadow-oryctolagus-cuniculus-norderney-island-lower-saxony-78982277.html) where the rabbits were accidentally brought to the island by humans.	Animals are not morally equivalent to humans and therefore do not possess an equal natural right to live.	Most animals whose meat is eaten have been the property of humans. Their property rights conflict with animal rights.	Humans currently give different consideration to animals such as pets \(whom we care for\) and farm animals \(whom we eat\). This is an arbitrary line to draw, as both have the same right to live.	Humans are at the top of the food chain, which means that they are merely following the natural order of things when they kill and eat other animals.	The limited sentience of most animal species means that they can be used to fulfill human desires, such as through farming, as long as it is not unnecessarily cruel.	Because animals feel, they should be treated according to [utilitarian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), which advocates maximising pleasure and minimising suffering for all sentient beings.	Animals do not have "rights" at all. They live in a state of eat or be eaten. Rights do not exist in the natural world at all, only in the socially constructed world that humans have created for themselves.	"Human rights" are not laws of the universe but rather a practical tool humans use to govern interaction with each other. They are a means of outlining and governing acceptable behavior so that we may live peacefully with each other. We can do this because we can communicate with each other and hold each other accountable. We cannot communicate with other species and hold them accountable in the same way yet.  A wolf does not understand, and will not respect, a universal right to life.	Even if animals did live free of human slaughter, they would most likely die due to consumption by predators anyways so you might as well use the animals in a way that benefits humans.	It would be good to eradicate certain Mosquitos and parasites, so they cannot have such a right.	A chicken or cow doesn't have any frame of reference, and hence doesn't know what a good or bad life is. We like to attribute meaning to our own lifes and subsequently, animals lives too. If a chicken does not know what it is like to live in the wilderness then is it suffering inside?	Humans are not superior to any other animal, they are simply a small part of a whole ecosystem. As such, they have no legitimate right to kill animals as they please.	Imagine we could harvest meat from a meat plant. If you believe it is more ethical to harvest meat from a plant than from an animal, then you recognize that harvesting meat from animals is unethical.	It is our moral duty to minimize the suffering we cause to conscious beings. To the degree to which a being has the capacity to suffer, we have a responsibility to minimize the suffering we cause it.	This statement is illogically selective. Why it should apply to just animals versus all living things? Why do all plants or microbes not have a right to live and be free of suffering?	Animals bred for meat would not exist if their meat was not to be consumed. Wherein does their right to life reside if nobody is willing to create the circumstances of their existence?	Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.	Animals are sentient beings - they feel pain and have complex emotional lives. Many have family structures and are able to bond. Killing them for our pleasure when alternatives exist is immoral and archaic.	Meat comes from a living source that only dies in order for us to sustain our own living. We say it is morally incorrect to kill another human being but for an animal it is okay? This belief is hypocritical in nature.	Without the raising of animals for slaughter, they wouldn't have had a life in the first place. They are fed and raised to maturity.	Animals feel pain. And if you suggest that they are inferior therefore you have the right to do anything to them, you should also have the right to do anything you want with mentally challenged people or any other human who is inferior to you. Society is better than in the past exactly because of empathy from which morality arises. It is time to get past our arrogance towards other animals.	70 billion animals [are sacrificed every year for consumption](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/3640540/ciwf_strategic_plan_20132017.pdf).	Ethics persuade us that we have a duty not to exploit anyone, and beyond that, a duty to actively help all victims of exploitation from their plight to the best of our ability. Animals in this case are innocent victims of mass exploitation.	The type of intensive agriculture required to produce vegetarian food on a scale to feed current populations inherently causes the death of animals. To plant acres of soy one must displace every single animal living there, eradicate every bird, mouse, squirrel that would eat the crop, poison every insect, grind up every creature in the path of the harvester, etc. Farming is an ecological disaster that represents death to every living being that is not the crop.

Conscious vegetarianism facilitates compassion towards other living beings and discourages us from viewing them as mere ingredients to a recipe.	pro	It is hard to feel sympathy for being one never sees, or interacts with, even if the alternative is only seeing them as part of a meal.	Many who eat meat also feel compassion towards other animals. It is very possible to research where your meat comes from to ensure that no cruel methods were used in raising the animal, and in the case of hunting, thinning the population allows for expansion of resources, allowing the survivors a greater ability to thrive. This also allows their offspring more room to grow with less competition.	Conscious vegetarianism facilitates a lack of compassion toward other living beings because they see plants as mere ingredients to a recipe.	Specifically, it facilitates the reduction of suffering among living beings capable of suffering. Reducing suffering is good.	The above claimant presumes to know what human beings "feel" when they eat meat, and how those human beings view life. It is an inaccurate representation, and therefore it is invalid.	Conscious living facilitates compassion toward other living beings. Vegetarianism is not a necessary component of this.	By consuming farmed meat you are [ingesting the suffering and trauma those animal experienced in their short lives](http://sciencenordic.com/meat-stressed-animals-unhealthy) which has potential metaphysical consequences we cannot comprehend.	Eating someone or parts of someone is contradictory to compassion. Compassion involves the understanding of suffering and its reduction as much as possible. It is unlikely that there is not any suffering associated with the steps involved in eating a living being.	Love for fellow Earthlings would include the notion that our lives are precious and, therefore, we are not something to be eaten.	The thinking man must oppose all cruel customs no matter how deeply rooted in tradition and surrounded by a halo.

Specifically, it facilitates the reduction of suffering among living beings capable of suffering. Reducing suffering is good.	pro	Not all moral systems are centred on the reduction of suffering.	If reducing suffering is the only measure of good, the logical conclusion is that we must end all life to end all suffering. This is inherently wrong.	If reducing suffering is good, but we do not have to end suffering entirely, then responsible farming of domesticated livestock accomplishes this end, as few domesticated animals living in these circumstances will suffer as much, or die as miserably as their wild counterparts.	If the only moral factor is 'reducing suffering is good', then a responsible hunter who kills their prey quickly is more moral than a vegan who eats foods harvested from large fields where animals are caught and maimed by harvesting equipment. The hunter is more responsible than that same group because field crops cause animals to reproduce more quickly, only to have their food supply eliminated as winter approaches, with few natural predators nearby to bring them swifter death than starvation.	I don't think we can say definitively that it reduces suffering. Are plants capable of suffering? I know some would say so. Are insects capable of suffering? How would you define suffering? Is one creature's suffering more relevant than another's? Which is worse, the death and suffering of a million insects, a hundred mice, or a single cow?

Domesticated animals, including animals raised for meat, [show significantly lower levels of the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine than their wild counterparts](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/bambi-or-bessie-are-wild-animals-happier/).	If domesticated animals are raised ethically in a way as to have reasonable lives, then they are allowed to exist and experience life, where in a world without meat farming they probably would not.	The rearing of animals need not be seen as 'solely for eating', with additional responsibilities requiring a reasonable life. If meat consumption ceased, it is unlikely the farm animals would be reintroduced to the wild, they would simply vanish from existence.	In the wild, there are no such concepts as compassion or malice. There is only nature, which is primal and brutal. A swift death at the hands of a hunter or farmer who will use the animal for food, clothing, etc. is a far better death than by natural predators, disease, or famine.

"Culture" is not important. Cultural behaviors can be positive or negative. The practice of female genital mutilation is not something we should strive to protect simply because it is part of the culture. Slavery was our culture once. People fought and died to preserve that culture, yet the culture was wrong, just as the culture of eating animal products is.	Culture should not dictate morality.	The cultural basis for meat consumption originated in hunter gatherer times. We no longer live in hunter gather societies and therefore dietary custom is an antiquated justification for meat consumption. Hunter gatherer meat consumption is more justified than agrarian meat consumption because meat was a scarcity that had to be earned; consequently it was the highlight of the meal. The amount of meat consumed is unnatural and is therefore at odds with the foundation of this cultural argument.	Slavery was once accepted by the society and their culture. This does not mean it is morally justified.	Not all cultural or religious values should be respected.  They are not equally valid.	People live traditionally and rarely stop to ask whether our traditions are blinding us from the reality of the cruel way we indirectly treat certain animals. At the root of their treatment is discrimination, which leads to exploitation and abuse. Eating animals in the modern world is cruel because it is no longer necessary to eat animals to survive and live a healthy life. If these animals we not bred into existence, there would be no need for them to exist in the wild.	Eating meat was necessary for survival. Many meat-eating cultures have some inherent respect for the animals they eat. If there is no longer a necessity to eat meat to survive, the slaughter is purely for gratification; we should reduce our consumption, and develop other ways of fulfilling our recreational eating desires.	More humans eat meat than choose to abstain from eating meat, and most abstention is poverty based. Whilst non-meat eaters are the more vocal and empassioned cohort on this issue, this does not make them the majority and societal intersubjective truths are generally determined by majority thought constructs. In other words, eating meats is okay because most humans believe it to be okay.	It's not ethically wrong since the definition of "Ethical" is "A set of moral values and principles that guide the human conduct in the society". Knowing that, the most part of the society eat meat and don't see any problem in this. We can declare it not ethically wrong.[Ethical Definition \( Brazil Website \)](https://www.suapesquisa.com/o_que_e/etica_conceito.htm)	The argument that something is part of a dominant culture was used to justify numerous evils of human history, from racism to corruption and the suppression of minorities.	According to [moral absolutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism), particular actions are intrinsically right or wrong.	As there are no absolute standards for judging right and wrong, good and bad, as these terms are products of social agreement, individuals can only use their culture and the values / attitudes it has created for moral guidance. From this point of view, the dominant culture thus explains and justifies behavior.	The amounts of culturally-prescribed meat, for example at rituals, are limited and thus come with marginal negative effects. There is nothing to justify.

vegetarian diets directly and indirectly contribute to better health outcomes for all humans.	3_1.10.	Vegetarian diets directly and indirectly contribute to better health outcomes for all humans.	pro	The meat industry has harmful effects on the physical and mental health of its workers. Eradication of this industry would reduce these harms.	Scientists have concluded that vegetarian diets can in fact [provide benefits](http://freefromharm.org/featured-articles/catching-up-with-science-burying-the-humans-need-meat-argument/) in the treatment and prevention of certain diseases.	People who must already follow [restrictive diets](http://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/) due to medical conditions such as IBS or IBD cannot consume most plant-based or dairy sources of protein, making it necessary for them to resort to meat-based proteins.	Meat consumption itself is not unhealthy. It strongly depends on the [amount](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/meat.aspx) consumed as well as its origin - whether it is from industrial livestock farming or organic farming.	Eating meat is linked to increased risks for certain types of cancer.	The farming of meat can fuel the spread of disease and ingestion of drugs that may pose significant risks to human health.	Meat effectively delivers important nutrients for humans.	[Statistically](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088278.PDF) those who abstain from a meat based diet are exposed to higher health risk hazards.	Meat-eaters suffer more frequently from various types of [food poisoning](http://www.celestialhealing.net/physicalveg3.htm) than vegetarians.	Living without meat reduces [metabolic risk](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/34/5/1225.abstract) factors and thus reduces the likelihood of strokes, diabetes, and heart conditions.	Not all vegetarians have a healthy diet. There is a lot of meatless junk food available. Hence, an absence of meat in a diet does not equal a healthier diet.	The [fact](http://qz.com/91123/vegetarians-live-longer-but-its-not-because-they-dont-eat-meat/) that vegetarians live longer \(up to nine years\) is not only due to their meatless diet, but also to the fact that they are more likely to exercise, smoke less and drink less alcohol.	When looking at smaller sample sizes and more diverse diets there is little to suggest that meat is inherently unhealthy.	Meat consists of a lot of protein. Therefore, its consumption leads to increased intake of protein. [The China Study](https://www.amazon.co.uk/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660) measured the ideal daily intake to be 8 to 10 percent, whereas most people consume twice as much.	Avoidance of all meat is a luxury good, only realistic in a healthy manner, in rich societies. In poor societies practicing vegetarianism, it often correlates with malnutrition. In most societies, this claim is both arrogant and moralizing, condemning poor countries to malnutrition, contributing to expanding in equality.	Vegetarian foods are nutritionally superior to meat.	Meat is dangerous in that it increases the risk of injuries to those who eat meat.	Assuming that vegans are healthier and do live longer, these extra years of life mean that they continue to damage the environment. This makes it less ethical, not more, to remove meat from people's diets.	Whether or not people have better or worse health outcomes due to their diet is irrelevant to the claim that people should completely stop eating meat. It is only an argument to restructure health policy to reduce meat consumption or encourage veganism.	Vegetarian diets are only more beneficial for the health of an individual if they are [well balanced](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/tc/vegetarian-diets-how-can-vegetarians-eat-a-balanced-diet), [and if compared to an unbalanced omnivorous diet.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3967195/) The essence in the question of health is not that which is more healthier: eating, or not eating animal related products, but the overall quality and composition of a diet.	You can eat healthy and eat meat. It is just that most people do not follow diets and they would probably not follow them if they were forced to be vegetarian.	A substantial population require meat in their diet for health reasons, as thousands of [stories show](http://meatheals.com/).	[We are not meant to eat meat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58) A lot of people have explained how we have not developed biologically to hunt, consume or digest meat, here is a 30 minute explanation from a former meat lover turned vegan. Fridges should be gardens not morgues.	[All diets](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/95/3/614/4578300) generally lead to better health outcomes compared to people who do not follow a restrictive diet, because people on a diet make conscious decisions about their food.	A vegetarian diet might lead to better health outcomes, but for some who live in countries where getting vegan/vegetarian food easily isn't an option, a non-veg diet is a trade off between health and convenience.

A major [study by Oxford University](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/201603_Plant_based_diets) concluded that universal adoption of vegetarian diets could avoid 7.3 million deaths per year by 2050.	There is much we do not yet understand about gut health and how the body metabolises and interacts with foods.	Individual studies might show advantages to a vegetarian diet, but [literature reviews](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/science-compared-every-diet-and-the-winner-is-real-food/284595/) show no significant gains when all the various popular diets are compared to each other. Many different diets based primarily on the idea that we should eat whole food and mostly plants all show substantial health gains. We don't need to remove meat to achieve the health outcomes -- we just need to make sure we get enough plants and focus on unprocessed foods.	Eating meat is no longer necessary due to the range of meat substitutes on offer.	The [American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://freefromharm.org/featured-articles/catching-up-with-science-burying-the-humans-need-meat-argument/) has stated that well planned vegetarian diets are nutritionally adequate and appropriate for individuals at all stages of life.	In the long run \(many years into the diet\), vegetarianism makes people depressed, as stated by Lierre Keith in her book The Vegetarian Myth.	The idea of a meatless diet being weak or deficient in protein is not accurate as we know some of the strongest animals on Earth are vegetarian.	This health claim was promoted by vegetarian societies that deceptively qualified their dietary recommendation with "well-planned" when this doesn't belong to any single food group.	The alleged health benefits of vegetarianism came from caloric restriction and fibre, both of which can be gotten from omnivory and carnivory, whereas alcohol and tobacco are both plant products that were arbitrarily excluded in the vegetarian diet.	Freefromharm.org contradicts itself where it says our species needs the same nutrients but then some of us are allergic or diseased \[but doesn't say so by genetics\].  Thus some lack the ability to digest lactose in milk, gluten in wheat, beta-carotene in several crops, albumen in egg white, glucose-6-phosphate in fava, and lectins in seeds and nightshades.	The [phytate](https://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=phytate%7Cphytic+rickets%7Cpellagra%7Cberiberi) antinutrient in whole grains has killed 100,000s by [pellagra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellagra#History) and [ric](http://austinpublishinggroup.com/pediatrics/fulltext/download.php?file=ajp-v1-id1001.pdf)[k](https://books.google.com/books?id=4IhXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA443&lpg=PA443)[ets](https://books.google.com/books?id=zp30zkTvfmMC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90).  Tannin antinutrients destroy thiamine in the bran that has the same phytate which without the bran causes beriberi.	A vegetarian diet requires a complete set of disparate ingredients that, when taken in bad proportion or alone, cause heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cavities, osteoporosis, kidney stones, fatigue, brain fog, and malnutrition.  The nutritional supplements with the diet suffer from different bioavailabilities such that amine and vitamin compounds cause overdose of calcium and transition metals whereas carbonate and citrate compounds are not absorbed well.	The same species does require very different nutrients.  Freefromharm.org will quote-mine nutritionists, rather than doctors or scientists, for requirements when it serves their position even if it supports opposite premises: milk is only for babies which is why adults lose the ability to digest milk \(same species\) but everyone needs the same nutrients.

The studies that claim animal over plant diets use more resources such as fuel, irrigation, land, and fertilizer discount the fuel spent to transport crops from the climates suited to them like volcanic, tropical, and marine environments \(e.g. 9000 miles for coconuts between Oceania and America\) and the greater land and fertilizer use for human crops on soils that don't natively support staples.	India has a wide adoption of vegetarianism but its lifespan lags France, whose diet is rich in saturated fat and livestock, by 20 years.  The leading cause of death in India is heart disease.

These animals spend a majority of their time eating and their stomachs are designed to process hard to digest plant matter. Humans are not designed to eat purely plants in the same way and therefore cannot subsist on the same diet and expect the same results.

an individual should be free to choose any food they want to eat \(without interference\).	0_1.1.	An individual should be free to choose any food they want to eat \(without interference\).	con	Being vegan could motivate or inspire other people to become vegan of their own volition.	This sentiment problematically suggests that we can all act as we wish to, regardless of the harm caused to others. If this were the case, any immoral action could be justifiable on grounds of personal freedom.	It can both be the case that someone ought to do something and that they should remain free not to do it if they wish. Thus, it may be the case that one ought to be vegan and yet should remain free not to be vegan if they so choose.	Choices are and will always be limited.	It is speciesist to grant humans the right to eat meat on grounds of their enjoyment or freedom when raising cattle for human consumption necessitates depriving these animals of the same rights to freedom and enjoyment.	It's a loaded statement, a ["begging the question" fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/53/Begging-the-Question) where the word 'food' is used to make the statement seem reasonable. So, yes humans should be free to choose any food they wish, but not animals \(which in reality are not food\).	The most commonly agreed benefit of veganism is morality, yet it is [not undisputed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/pop-psych/201311/curious-case-vegan-moral-hypocrisy). Claiming that all humans should become vegan is therefore no more justified than insisting that all people follow a single religious teaching.	Since coercion is not justified there is no way to make all humans stop eating meat.	Food preferences are a personal choice, as morality is personal and people are free to decide what is the right and wrong food after listening to their conscience.	Veganism is a choice and should not be forced on children until they are old enough to decide for themselves.	If everyone wants to eat vegan it'll be free will that gets us there, rather than being a hindrance to it.	Many people gain substantial happiness from their non-vegan diet.	Over the course of history, humans have evolved to become omnivores and this can no longer be changed.	Free humans who are adequately informed and supported would make the correct choice, whatever that may be. This conversation is intended to find what that correct choice is, not decide top-down what we should force on individuals.	Society should protect, and not get in the way of, an individual's freedom of choice.	It is immoral to restrict the rights of other humans to eat animals, so long as in doing so they do not infringe on the rights of other humans.	Unlike many examples of immoral behaviour such as homicide, whether eating meat constitutes an immoral act is not widely agreed-upon. In such cases where a consensus opinion is lacking, it seems questionable that arbitrary moral standards should be applied.	Saying that everybody should do something because somebody else thinks this is good is a mix of arrogance and ignorance.

For example here is a [list.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_philosophies)	Utilitarianism does not concern itself with motives only outcomes and as such the "[moral luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_luck)" problem is one that it can't escape.

Animals are killed in inhumane ways by predators like lions, eagles, and so on in nature.

There are many examples of animals being killed in extremely inhumane ways, even when better alternatives are the norm.

We have the higher thinking to understand we are taking a life and that we have other food options, that is what makes it morally wrong.	The reason why humans kill less animals is because there is a proportionally smaller population of humans to all the animals who eat meat in the world, not because humans are more moral in killing animals.	Some methods that carnivores have for eating are actually beneficial for an ecosystem.	What goes on in nature is irrelevant in this case because veganism is about reducing the harm caused by humans.	With regard to the definition \([1st one](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/humane)\) of humane, killing perfectly healthy animals just because of preference or taste is neither tender nor compassionate and shows no sympathy for the animal. There is no way to kill a human humanely, nor an animal.	Predators often [wound prey and let it die for hours or days](https://io9.gizmodo.com/9-predators-with-the-most-brutal-hunting-techniques-510100768) to get an easy prey in the wild, so humans eating an animal through killing it quickly and with as little pain as possible would be more ethical than this.	The amount of animals killed by humans are way smaller than the "natural" biosystem altogether, so these minor amounts are marginal in the overall larger picture.	Humans have technology to kill animals more ethically than we our any animal could in nature to the point it creates such minimal harm that it's not unethical at that point.

Thus, what one eats is not entirely their choice, but instead dictated by their environment \(a.k.a. what's available\).	Choice only makes sense if people's actions do not affect anyone else's. Once it affects others, people's choices do not get to be entirely their own.	Some people feel the need to eat meat \(both for health or for their body asking for it\). It's unfair to prohibit it.	Being able to make a vegan choice or non vegan choice is an important freedom. When we can engage in a balanced decision process, we are more likely to see diverse outcomes \(that move towards total veganism\) e.g. eating much less meat/ only eating meat at traditional festivities

Prohibitions may be a necessity to get maintain the world to prevent it from getting worse, in which case it is very justifiable to prohibit animal products when it leads to issues. If anything, it's unfair to others not to prohibit it.

Depriving them of something that a person truly feels in need of \(even if in reality it's not true\) would be unethical if no better alternative is provided.	Prohibiting animal products would allow people to be better off, as they can both simultaneously get away from harm and also have an alternative that gives them benefits.

It's really meat that's forced onto children rather than the other way around, as everyone starts off with eating vegan foods when they are young and only start to eat meat later when their bodies can handle it.	The parent should be able to act as a moral compass and mediate their child’s behaviour to act in accordance with their virtues \(including not choosing veganism for the negative reasons\), at least until they're old enough to make their own, better decisions.	A child will look up to the parents for guidance \(like when they lie, can't forgive someone, steal, or when they choose to or not to eat meat\). So parents can provide their advice to them when they are ready for it, so their children can make decisions for themselves based on what they hear.

It is immoral to restrict the rights of other humans to eat animals, so long as in doing so they do not infringe on the rights of other humans.	con	Humans should not be given special treatment solely out of morality as humans are animals too. They should be allowed to be eaten if they are weak, because morality is subjective and has no function in my quest for survival through nourishment.	True, that is why veganism works, because people's rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is infringed due to the few people that want to eat meat.	It is immoral to restrict the rights of animals in order to give humans more rights \(especially when humans do not need animals to live\).	The well-being of people has more value than the well-being of animals.	Whether or not humans are "restricted" from eating meat does change that they morally should not do so. As an analogy, in a society with free speech you are not restricted from saying horrible things about other people or lies, but it does not change that you should not do so.	There is no right that allows us inflict unnecessary suffering on anyone. Not on animals, not on humans. While restricting the rights of other humans to eat animals is immoral, what is truly immoral here is mass murder of animals that is happening at the moment. Thus, the right of the animal to live trumps the right of humans to eat animals, due to a greater morality priority.	It is immoral to restrict the rights of other humans to eat anything \(including vegan food\), yet it still happens. If humans weren't restricted in what they eat, then there may be more vegans.	No one's stopped from making their own decisions when going vegan, as they'll come to it through their own free will. They'll still eat what they want, but through a vegan framework.

Humans are not [unique with abilities and skills, and if anything, worse than other animals](https://visual.ly/community/infographic/science/difference-between-humans-and-animals). That does make humans less valuable. Basing value on criteria does not make sense in regard to abilities and skill.	Some humans are born with disorders that greatly reduce their cognitive / physical abilities, yet we do not deem it ethical to kill humans of much lesser intelligence. We currently base the value of an animal on its species, not its abilities, intelligence or sentience.	Intelligence and emotional comprehension are hard to measure and all such measurements are taken from a human point of view, so it's only natural that humans come out on top in such comparisons. Vegans base their moral considerations on empathy \(recognizing that non-human animals have many of the same needs as humans as well as the capability to suffer\) instead of pseudo-objective measurements of intelligence.	Emotional comprehension's just one factor. The benefit that they bring to the world and others has value too.

However, if we don't want this to continue, then we shouldn't act like this \(as we can do something about ourselves\) to make it acceptable, just because it is in nature.

[Natural selection](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling2.htm) will correct for species' overpopulation eventually.	Without a top predator \(like humans\) to [selectively cull](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling.htm) the old and sick, entire populations \(species grouping \(like a herd\) or the total population of ecosystems\) might not survive \(due to starvation, etc.\).

Humans being the strongest predator in the ecosystem, in reality, cause, rather than prevent, damage to it that this discussion needed to be created in the first place. So removing them would lead to less disruption and imbalance \(like overpopulation of weaker species\), not more.	The remaining livestock on farms if everyone became vegan right now would pose a serious issue. The reproduction of the herd wouldn't stop and the excess of animals would be very harmful to nature if they are released into the wild.	We eat the meat of farmed animals, not wild animals. So if we stop eating meat and stop animal farming, it won't affect wildlife because we do not take from their population to begin with.	There could be other ways to control animal population than killing them.

Thus, the smallest number of organisms ought to be killed for food. It is better to kill only the vegetation to feed a man than to kill the vegetation to feed a cow and then kill the cow to feed the man. By reducing intermediaries, veganism preserves the most life, even if all life is to be valued equally.	Humans consider animal pain to be more important than plant pain only because of the former's proximity to their lived experience. This is an anthropocentric bias.	Plants are not the same as humans, as they are autotrophs, and thus do not require the destruction of life in their consumption practices \(unless it's a carnivorous exception\).	Valuing animals above plants depends on their similarity to us and is therefore based on an anthropocentric bias. This defeats the implicit aim of veganism by assuming that humans are superior, which gives us reign to harm non-humans for our own benefit. A less anthropocentric veganism would value all life in parallel to human and animal life, rendering all human behaviour immoral by virtue of the way in which we treat bacteria, plants etc. in order to sustain ourselves.	An "all or nothing" approach [is logically fallacious](http://www.academia.edu/21565174/Fallacy_All_or_Nothing) and hinders progression in the field of animal rights and ethics. Nowadays, social and political change is achieved through reforms, not revolutions. This means we don't need to have everything figured out before we can start working on improving and protecting animals' lives.	In reality, everyone has different moral standards for different species, not just vegans. The vast majority of people do not consider plants to be as morally significant as animals. If given the choice between cutting the stems of a dozen daisies or cutting off a dog's head, the average person will choose to kill the daisies without hesitation.

There is a moral argument to stop eating meat altogether \(as well as fish and animal derived products\): animals are sentient beings with a will to live, and it is therefore more ethical to avoid inflicting suffering to other animals, for the same reason as it is more ethical to avoid inflicting suffering to other human beings.	[Free range chickens](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/30/free-range-eggs-con-ethical) are still slaughtered, selectively bred for rapid growth to a point where for some, their legs can't support them, and kept in overcrowded barns. Free Range doesn't equal a happy life for the animal.	Scientific advancements are making ethical alternatives increasingly possible for those wishing to taste meat without creating moral harms.	Bans on eating certain meats to treat animals fairly \(like protecting endangered species\) create a new ethical issue in themselves: a legal justification for eating meat \(by sideswiping its ethical problems\) through [carnism](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/carnism-why-eating-animals-is-a-social-justice-issue/). This would make oppressive speciesism \(as it favors one species over another\) socially acceptable, which is avoidable if we go vegan.	One can eat local meat and animal products without patronizing any products from the industrial meat production industry.	Animal product consumption is not inherently unethical, only causing undue or excessive suffering is. If the industry can be improved to minimise/eliminate suffering, then there is no ethical basis behind condemning it.	The argument that the meat industry 'could be more ethical' is greatly a weak one because there is a big difference between 'could be' and 'will be'.	The meat production industry being unethical might imply that all humans should become vegetarian, but it does not imply that all humans should become vegan.

Going against the laws could get people into legal trouble.	Many chickens have been bred to produce more eggs than is healthy for them to do so. This is because their calcium can become [severely depleted](https://mikethechickenvet.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/bones-shells-and-hen-health/), and it is difficult to feed them enough to overcome this.	Most backyard chickens are hens \(females\). Most of the cocks \(males\) will have been killed at hatching.	Most backyard chickens are still killed for food once they stop laying frequently.	While keeping a single chicken may well not be cruel the demand for meat far outstrips that. It is not feasible to support the world on this small scale farming, thus by not being vegan humans are forced to turn to crueler methods.	Even in supposedly ethical free-range backyard farming where chickens are not harmed, other animals might be: chickens are omnivores so may consume or otherwise impact insects and other wildlife where they are kept, and thereby disrupt the native ecosystem/food chain there.

The harm from producing crops is offset by crops that double as wildlife reserves \(like [rice paddies](https://www.manomet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Rice-Fields-for-Wildlife-Folk-et-al-2016-compressed.pdf)\).	If more investment in production of plant-based food could be made, allied to cellular agriculture and the notion that animal life is as valuable, we as a global society would learn effective ways to produce animal products without slaughtering farmed livestock and sacrificing the animals that die in plant-based cultures.	For raising animals, you need plants and while producing this you also kill the mice and snakes that live there.

All animals are eventually killed, whether by humans or other animals or nature. Meat producers [usually want](http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/cattle-stress.html) animals to die quickly to prevent pain-associated chemicals from forming, as they spoil the meat. Thus, they use the most humane means possible.	It's better for an animal to live a short life than no life at all, assuming any amount of life to be a net positive.	Domesticated animals, livestock and other animals that depend on humans would starve to death.	There is no reason to believe that these animals would live in worse conditions in a vegan world. As for not getting the chance to live, it is arguably better than living a short and unpleasant life. Besides, not being born is not usually seen as a harm - on the contrary, we often practice birth control on ourselves and other animals because overpopulation is a concern.	Breeding and raising animals for no purpose \(since we wouldn't eat them in a vegan world\) would come at some expense. So it's a worse condition overall than if we don't add more animals to the world that don't need to be here.	That's only a temporary situation, the 'worse conditions', as when those animals are gone, then there are no animals around to have a chance to live in poor conditions.	The reproductive strategy that farmers evolutionarily impose on livestock \(a.k.a.

This [mutualistic](https://sciencing.com/symbiotic-relationship-8794702.html) symbiotic relationship is beautiful, benefits both humans and farm animals, and there is no reason to destroy it.	For the animals we bring into this world, many others don't get the chance to be born because of it. So we're not really helping more lives be born insomuch as deciding who gets to be born.

For dairy cows this fraction is ~0.25 and for chickens raised for meat 0.02 \([hsi.org.au](https://hsi.org.au/go/to/70/farm-animal-welfare.html#.WtTolIhuaM8)\).	Farming practices should not be described as "protecting" animals and "taking care of offspring" when it inevitably leads to the death of the animals and their offspring for the financial gain of the producer.	There's no such thing as ethical killing. If animals are taken care only for the purpose of killing them that is ethically wrong when there is an alternative.	The non-industrialized production and use of dairy products \(milk and eggs\) is not innately exploitative or unethical because domesticated animals do not suffer, but are are rather fed, nurtured, and protected by the humans that raise them in a mutually beneficial process.	Even if a farmed animal is treated well, the amount of lives negatively impacted by its existence is still very high. Species who are going extinct because of deforestation to make room for farmland, animals killed in the harvesting of the many crops you need to feed a single animal. Even cats have become a burden on many ecosystems, threatening rodent and bird populations. You're exchanging one arguably good life for dozens of others.	Caring for an animal and eating its flesh after it has died from natural causes would be ethical.	Humane farming is only marginally better than traditional animal agriculture, yet notoriously hard to implement because of backlash from the industry and consumers who fear [rising prices](https://www.ethicalfarmingfund.org/post/2018/05/30/the-truth-behind-the-price-of-humanely-raised-food).	Selective breeding methods, which are inherent to animal farming, are immoral.

If we allow animals to live long and fulfilled lives before eating them, raising and killing them for food would be a lot less economically feasible, leading to a major drop in the availability of animal products \(or extremely increased prices\), which would in turn lead to an almost-vegan diet anyways.	Free-range is an [elastic term](https://youtu.be/NxvQPzrg2Wg?t=5m4s), meaning that the definition is arbitrary and can be changed. Likely free-range will not be [much better or more ethical](https://youtu.be/NxvQPzrg2Wg?t=5m4s) than conventional farming \(if we don't account for the environment\).	From the animal's perspective, there is no purpose to their existence. Even if they had the cushiest, nicest life, it would not be worth living for them \(unless they want to be meat for people, which would only happen in rare instances\). The only value that the animal's life is worth living for is for humans \(like the farmer\). The farmer only thinks the life is valuable to an animal because of their anthropocentric, predatory-perspective biases.

The opportunity for moral good is maximised where life with the emotional capacity for joy/pleasure/fulfillment is allowed to thrive. Livestock should therefore take priority over plant and fungal life.	con	This would be valid if animal agriculture created joy and fulfillment, but it mainly creates suffering.	Plants can have joy/pleasure/fulfillment when allowed to thrive too. We should not let our quest for 'emotional capacity' get in the way of giving as much life freedom and quality-of-life they deserve, no matter how they enjoy it. Instead we should embrace and bring life that comes our way into this world unbiased \(a.k.a. no priority\) if we can bring them happiness.	Just because we do not know at this moment that plants do not have an emotional capacity for enjoyment, does not mean that such enjoyment does not exist within them. We just do not know about it. We should err on the side of caution \(instead of assuming they don't and be wrong\) until we know better \(research is still in its [infancy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/the-intelligent-plant) in the plant neurobiology field\).

Domesticated animals, livestock and other animals that depend on humans would starve to death.	con	A cow's typical life-span is 25 years. Cows used in dairy production are [exhausted](http://www.ad-international.org/farm_animals/go.php?id=120) and for most part killed after 4-5 years.	Animals can fend for themselves. Human existence occurred after the first animals.	Most of the animals dependent on humans are in that situation because humans put them in it. When all humans will be vegan there won't be any more animals bred for farms. All animals dependent on humans should be prevented from breeding.	The number of domesticated animals would gradually but drastically diminish \(probably of several orders of magnitude\) as the practice of forced, artificial reproduction would be dismissed; the remaining "domesticated" animals would be taken care of by their owners.

Alternatively, if all humans became vegan, then all the animals on farms would be killed anyway as no-one is going to pay to look after them.

Humans realize which genes and traits keep an animal alive and which do not. Without humans, the livestock's evolutionary line might not be here today.	Since animals and humans conflict for the same food source, it is more ethical to keep animals around than kill them in order to eat the single source of food.

Both humans and animals get unique experiences \(especially shared ones\) from animal agriculture and wouldn't if the process didn't exist.	The same could be said about plants.

There are no exclusively vegan crops. Food and products consumed by vegans are also eaten/used by non-vegans directly, and indirectly via the livestock they consume.	Welfare standards of farmers are a separate issue from the issues veganism tries to solve.

Veganism accepts valuing humans/animals over other lifeforms, which is almost as bad as omnivores accepting valuing humans over animal/other lifeforms.	con	Humans require food to live and all known food sources require consuming some other organism. Veganism values life more than non-veganism as non-veganism kills organisms to feed livestock and then kills the livestock to feed humans. In contrast, veganism kills only the vegetation.	Valuing animals above plants depends on their similarity to us and is therefore based on an anthropocentric bias. This defeats the implicit aim of veganism by assuming that humans are superior, which gives us reign to harm non-humans for our own benefit. A less anthropocentric veganism would value all life in parallel to human and animal life, rendering all human behaviour immoral by virtue of the way in which we treat bacteria, plants etc. in order to sustain ourselves.	Vegans' morality/ethics is always linked to animals we have empathy with, where we recognize ourselves as similar in the line of evolution, like mammals, fishes, birds, etc. It is acceptable to kill other kinds of lifelike non-pathogenic microbes or even vegetables, when no empathic sense is developed. Then, moral discourse just protects part of life, not life itself.	Veganism's morality is detrimental and exploitative to lifeforms outside of animals.	Vegan morality is inconsistent and hypocritical in valuing one life \(animals\) over another \(plants, fungi, and microbes\).	The premise that omnivores always value humans over animals is not always true. For instance, animals are not held to the same moral standards as humans. As a result, animals live freer lives which indicates that their lives are valued more than humans.	Without plants, humans would not be able to survive. Just about everything comes from them. To think of them poorly is degrading, as they provide more value at times than people and animals do.	Plants are our ancestors \(we share [half our DNA with bananas](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/humans-share-50-dna-bananas-2482139)\). If we're supposed to respect our ancestors, then we should respect them and value their lives too, instead of below us.

Veganism's morality is detrimental and exploitative to lifeforms outside of animals.	con	Veganism is, at the very least, no more detrimental to non-animal life than current widespread non-vegan agricultural practices. There is good reason to think it would be significantly less detrimental than such practices.	Killing wild plants affects entire ecosystems \(including wildlife and native cultures\), especially to the point that a major food source goes away. An example of this is cutting down trees that take a long time if ever to bear fruit if replanted \(such as [acorn trees in a drought-prone environment](https://www.kcet.org/shows/tending-the-wild/episodes/tending-the-wild)\).	Many plant species go extinct or endangered due to exploiting plants, especially in the essential oil industry with rare plants like [sandalwood](http://www.tambela.com/articles/sandalwood.php).	This impacts all life on Earth. For example, if a plant is not preserved in the Amazon due to deforestation for a crop, that plant cannot be examined to find it to be a[pharmaceutical breakthrough](http://rain-tree.com/) for a major disease.	Vegan ethics provide no protection for organisms outside the animal kingdom, such as unicellular and non-animal multi-cellular organisms.	Giving animals moral consideration is still better than not respecting the needs of other living beings at all. No one said veganism was the end all be all, we will still need to adapt and evolve our ethics continuously as science gives us more insight on what it means to be alive and sentient.	"Murdering" a carrot and murdering a dog are different acts. The argument that these are morally different hinges on sentience. It's the same reason turning off the life support machine sustaining a brain-dead patient is considered more acceptable than not treating a mentally alive person who would otherwise die from an illness. A body without consciousness doesn't care about what is done to it and has no sense of itself to lose, so its moral claim can't be equated with a sentient life's claim.

Less fighting creates a more ethical world overall too.	We cannot achieve peace, if we are not peaceful. Murdering animals is not an act of peace.

A vegan society offers the best way to manage resources.	None of us would be here without meat. The abundance we have now to make vegan choices may not be around in the future. It may save our lives yet in case in times of famine/ration \(such as a natural or nuclear disaster\). People will not have choices then, just like they did not in the past.	Not in every way does it restrict societal growth in terms of productivity and size, just redirects it in a different direction \(that provides benefits not currently seen\).	To date, no \(entirely\) vegan civilizations have been able to sustain themselves across a long period of time.	People learn about animals through non-vegan activities, like eating meat, having pets, visiting zoos, and hunting. Taking those activities away would make vegans less aware of animals due to less interactions with them.	Population growth is not a goal in itself to strive for. Quality of life is a better goal. This might require a lower population.	Not all growth of human civilization is positive, sustainable, or desired, so we shouldn't keep those around. What's better is civilization taking the action needed to be where it should be to reach its potential \(and if that means veganism, so be it\), even if it does come at the cost of growth.	Many of our achievements as a civilization have relied on controlling our violent and destructive tendencies and being compassionate instead. Choosing non-violence \(or minimal violence\) when it comes to our food is the next logical step in the development of a civilized population that grows beyond its biological instincts.	Animal consumption \(or anything for that matter\) restricts civilization growth too. So it's not a reason for civilization not to go vegan. Instead, if the benefits outweigh the costs, then that's what will matter in knowing what to decide upon.	Veganism restricts growth less than animal consumption does \(especially in the long run\), so it's worth implementing.

Choosing a vegan dish when at a social event is becoming easier, and even if you have to bring your own or modify a dish, often the venue owners are quite open minded to the idea of expanding their menu to meet the needs of potential customers.	If everyone was vegan then eating in social groups would no longer be problematic. Meat eaters expecting vegans to tolerate and participate in a death ritual is not equal to vegans expecting meat eaters to stop performing death rituals. No meat eater is harmed by having veganism forced upon them.

If all humans became vegan, then vegan food would be the food shared by people and it would again have the positive effects that this claim proposes.	Vegan food is actually easier to share, because there is more abundance due to less resources needed to grow vegan food.	Vegan food is meant to be shared, especially with fruit. Some fruit are so big \(like watermelon, jackfruit, and breadfruit\) that it would be extremely difficult for one person to eat it alone.	A cornucopia \(a basket overflowing with fruit and vegetables\) is symbolic of a [plentiful harvest](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cornucopia). That [abundance](https://www.brighthubeducation.com/history-homework-help/126590-what-is-a-cornucopia/) historically gets shared around Thanksgiving, when everyone feasts well.

It is possible to eat a healthy diet that includes meat and animal products.	con	While diets that include meat and animal products may be healthy, often their "healthiness" comes from reducing animal products.	Consuming animal products is healthy.	When compared side by side a plant based diet will be connected to less diseases than a meat/dairy based diet. If you want to eat a healthy diet including animal products you have to have a very limited consumption of it, and be super choosy about their quality and origin.	A vegan diet is a subset of an omnivorous diet. Therefore the claim above would imply that any amount, however small, of non-vegan food would always decrease the healthiness of a diet.	If that were true, then the top killer wouldn't be animal-based \(heart disease\), but it is. It can't be healthy and the top killer simultaneously, as that's a contradiction. So it can't be healthy to eat animal products.

veganism is incompatible with some cultural beliefs and practices.	0_1.5.	Veganism is incompatible with some cultural beliefs and practices.	con	The consumption of animal products forms a fundamental part of many cultures and traditions around the world.	People would end up being pushed towards associating with cultures they don't want to and/or normally not a part of, which wouldn't be likable by them.	If all humans became vegan, then humanity would lose a big part of its collective culture.

So even if veganism is incompatible with these cultural beliefs and practices, that would not be an issue in the future, as they won't be around for veganism to conflict with or disrupt them.	Preventing veganism is incompatible with some cultural beliefs and practices, so if we do not want to limit culture, we should not limit veganism.	There are no prohibitions for eating meat in the [10 commandments](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ten-Commandments). Therefore, it is not fundamentally incompatible with Christianity or Judaism.	Some cultures have non-vegan traditions.	Just because something is a cultural practice or deeply believed doesn't make it right or ethical. Ethics should always be more important than culture, tradition, or beliefs.	[Appeal to tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) is a logical fallacy.	Veganism is [more associated with liberals than conservatives or moderates](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/without-prejudice/201809/meat-eating-and-political-ideology). This may equate to, if non-liberals go vegan, associating with liberals more. This would take them away from their identity, beliefs, and ultimately participation in affiliated groups.	Even if the world went vegan, many people might retain their meat-eating cultural beliefs and memories. For these people, a vegan lifestyle may be impossible to sustain long term.	Veganism conflicts with religious beliefs and practices that people already have.

This would cause massive poverty, much as the [deindustrialisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindustrialization) has done already but on a larger scale.	Countries would be less self sufficient, and thus more vulnerable to global market and diplomatic volatility, in a vegan society because they would depend more on imports.	Animal rights organizations go north to Arctic communities and tell the Inuit populations that hunting seal is unethical and morally wrong. These same communities are then expected to [rely on imports from southern regions](https://goodfoodcentre.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/where-veganism-gets-food-security-wrong/) that are outrageously expensive.	If all of society was vegan then the cost of specialist vegan food would go down. Vegan food as a whole such as beans, grains and vegetables are already extremely affordable. B12 supplements and fortified foods are also extremely cheap.	[1/7](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM) of the world population's income depends directly or indirectly on livestock. Without alternative production methods a vegan world would result in more poverty of the rural areas.	Affordability does not determine whether something is good or desirable. If the thesis was "All humans should have access to clean water" nobody would dispute that on the basis of economic feasibility.	As countries become more developed, the issue of lesser privileged societies not being able to go vegan \(due to economic hardship\) will become less and less of an issue.	For extremely isolating places where all food is imported \(like Antarctica\), whether it's vegan or animal food won't matter much to their economy, as long as high quality/quantity/durability food comes in.

Living sustainably and in an environmentally-friendly way is not specific to the vegan or non-vegan life-style. Buying more seasonal and local produce is possible for vegans and non-vegans.

As people become vegan, their new values align with making more local choices in the process.	In the future, countries are going to be more self-sufficient, as the trends are heading towards there anyway \(mostly independent of veganism\).

"more poverty of the rural areas" - as you have described an area to be in poverty then that should include all living species within that area, of which include thousands of animals. The argumentation here is based on animal life having no value but commodity, and human life is the only one of importance. 'Poverty' can come in many forms and be applies to many lives.	Raising livestock makes poverty worse in rural areas than crops do, because livestock is less sustainable, ruining the land quicker until there is not much left, leaving people with no other means to keep their jobs going.

There are stringent rules and radical changes associated with veganism that are too difficult for the average person to easily incorporate into their lives.	con	Being vegan means "[A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism); etc." Thus, veganism only involves doing what is practicably possible, and so cannot by definition impose demands that are too difficult to meet.	The fact that something is difficult is not an excuse. If a person defers to the idea of it being the case, that is a choice in itself, a self-enacting postulate, and in essence amounts to active self-deceit based on either weakness, laziness, lecherousness, spite, or immorality - all of which are reprehensible in the context. A person can do it, it is a matter of them effectively choosing not to.	Veganism, unlike what [most people believe](https://selecthealth.org/blog/2019/10/breaking-5-myths-about-being-vegan), is very [easy to adopt](http://features.peta.org/how-to-go-vegan/) and absolutely [feasible](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/cost-vegan-diet-international-perspective).	The definition of veganism used in this discussion is arbitrary and has no end, as it asks adherents to reduce the exploitation of animals as much as possible. This makes the cutoffs \(of what veganism is/is not\) difficult to define and thus hard to follow.	Veganism has many similarities with [religion](https://medium.com/tenderlymag/is-veganism-a-religion-f195e1c23954), suggesting it has the potential to become too rigid, extreme, or intolerant of difference to be practicable on a global scale.	People can make minimal, practically unnoticeable vegan substitutions to their non-vegan lifestyle; so they won't notice enough to worry or miss out on its favorable aspects.	There is no quick fix for humanity's largest challenges. Abandoning progress altogether because of that would not make sense.	Veganism is [not just](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) abstaining from eating meat but also not using anything which uses animal products. This is an unrealistic standard as animal based products are unavoidable.	One would need almost expert-level knowledge of nutrition and skills to apply those concepts on a daily basis to themselves to maintain a vegan diet. Not everyone has these these abilities and as such could fail to get adequate nutrition levels to truly sustain themselves on it.	If everyone is vegan, those who find it difficult will have an infrastructure and support system to help them through the ups and downs of a vegan diet. So it may be impossible in this world, but not so much in a vegan society.	Following the ethical logic of veganism creates a high moral standard that humans would struggle to adapt to.	Real personal experiences and preferences in allowing veganism in their lives reveal that it's unrealistic and impractical for everyone in reality.

It is explicit in its unboundedness and lack of specifics, defined thus to allow for a set of moral principles that are not subject to contemporary science, industry, technological capabilities. "As far as is possible and reasonable" does not stand in relation to the individual, but to the set of general circumstances that envelop the individual. In the same wording it also mandates pressing on, improving on our capacities, to minimise it even further.	The vegetarian diet is easier to follow, as the definition is more concrete and objective.

For some, veganism means abstaining from all products from animals, including those that lived and died naturally.	The cutoff \(of what veganism is and is not\) might be definitive after all.	The definition used here is [pragmatic](http://www.flanderstoday.eu/living/vegan-visionary-preaches-pragmatism-instead-moralising), rather than dogmatic, and thus is actually easier to follow then other forms of veganism.	[Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) is taken on an individual basis \("as far as possible and practicable"\) This premeditated flexibility makes Veganism feasible for most people and circumstances.	The obscurity and lack of understanding the definition \(through its vagueness\) creates enough confusion to prevent people from having viability in making the decisions required for being vegan.	Arbitrary definitions should not stop the world from going vegan, as their nature allows them to be reformed. Thus, we can change the definition, through refining, what veganism is so that the world can actually adhere to it without conflict and confusion.	Having an arbitrary definition creates issues that push veganism into being short-lived or prevent it from emerging. We should not waste our time until the issues are resolved and the vegan movement can sustain itself into the long-term.	Because the definition's focus is on reduction and not elimination, animal exploitation could still take place.	-> See discussion #10281: There is no such thing as "vegan"

Animal based products are not unavoidable: from food to clothes, we can get everything we need without exploiting animals. With the increasing number of vegans, vegan products are becoming increasingly available as well. A proof of this is the very fact that thousands of vegans around the world live their life without buying animal products.	Even if animal products were unavoidable, veganism advocates [the reduction](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-there-no-such-thing-as-vegan-127588) 'as far as is possible and practicable'.	Veganism is a radical solution to the issues surrounding over-consumption of animal products in privileged societies. Humans should rather aim for moderation instead to make veganism more feasible for less privileged societies \(which is more difficult to do\).	Many humans, especially those in poverty, live in [food deserts](http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts/). They do not have easy access to the variety of vegetables, fruits, grains and supplements required to sustain a vegan diet as more privileged individuals do distance-wise. Vegan access will still be difficult logistically to work around if the world goes vegan.	The [Jainists](http://softschools.com/facts/religion/jainism_facts/2730/) have lived for [millennia](http://www.religionfacts.com/jainism/history) on a vegan diet. They were hardly privileged \(as they believe "[possessions are an obstacle to liberation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/aparigraha.shtml)"\). So in reality, it is the lesser-privileged societies that are more vegan, rather than the other way around.	Eating meat continuously is even more difficult to attain, due to their ability to create crises \(economic, politically, socially, etc., like in [China](https://youtu.be/rLR9TEUMgM8?t=273)\). This is why the majority of individuals in developing countries \(like China and India\) would like plant-based alternatives instead.	What vegans typically consume may not be [truly vegan](https://www.kialo.com/there-is-no-such-thing-as-vegan-2762.2204) and to be at that level would require removing so much or making such a large change that it would be nearly impossible to accomplish.

This change would lead to a greater environmental benefit than just everyone going vegan.	Since being vegan is often the result of a general interest in protecting the environment and sentient life-forms from unnecessary harm, vegan lifestyle is often accompanied by other lifestyle decisions that aim to reduce harm done to the environment. Vegans are thus more likely to show a broad spectrum of behaviour that aims to protect the environment.	Just because vegans "may" engage in other destructive activities does not mean they necessarily will. It certainly does not mean people should not go vegan, since some might perfectly fine transition without falling into moral self-licensing.	People may engage as much in these behaviors anyway if they are not vegan. If they are vegan, they are providing an overall greater benefit, even when engaging in these activities.	If going vegan makes one more prone to moral self-licensing, then transitioning to veganism should be consciously paired with other eco-friendly lifestyle choices, such as avoiding flight and fossile fuel car travel.	When everyone goes vegan, then new laws may come about to discourage people from engaging in worse activities to prevent climate change from affecting their region \(like a country\) anyway. Thus, this should not be a worry.

Since assisted death is often illegal and suicide is always discouraged the argument to “let people choose to live unhealthily and die sooner” seems weak. You would also have to change the ‘official’ guidance on nutrition to ensure people understand the health risks associated with consuming animal products.	The cost to health services would be too great - they are already struggling with funding and lack of resources - unless you refused treatment to anyone not following a vegan diet	Shorter lifespans in an age of explosive and ever-increasing population growth with people living longer is a really detrimental situation with an inconclusive outcome as to who perishes. At least with shorter lifespans, the population remains stable and we know the outcome of humanity, due to predictability of shorter lifespans.	Allowing for shorter lifespans allows for control over the fate of humanity, instead of being dictated and ruled by nature.

A vegan can abstain from eating non-vegan food, and thereby not attempt to violate the restaurant's right to self-determination.

How humans are meant to behave is not necessarily defined by what is best for their human health.	con	Many people would derive meaning from some of their habits despite the fact that they are not conducive to their health.	If a person's behaviour is harming their personal health, it is right to question whether the behaviour is violating their natural right to live a full, healthy life as nature intended. For instance, depression can cause self-injury and even risk suicide. Most lawmakers agree that if a cure for depression can prevent self injury, it should be forcibly applied even when the person does not want it.	An abnormal health condition can result in a risk to a person's life if they were to live a normal lifestyle. In context of veganism, if a person's digestive system has become unable to sustain life without eating meat, there is an unnatural conflict between the human's right to live versus the animal's right to live, where the vegan cannot ultimately choose to preserve the life of both.

the taste of meat is delicious and brings many people pleasure in a manner that vegetarian food cannot fully imitate.	3_1.1.	The taste of meat is delicious and brings many people pleasure in a manner that vegetarian food cannot fully imitate.	con	The demand for meat is rising globally. This clearly indicates its high popularity.	Non-meat products can offer an equivalently pleasing food experience.	Meat is convenient and consumer friendly.	Popularity and pleasure has no relevance to what is right or wrong.	Even if meat tastes good the experience overall is less desirable. First, the color scheme is not as colorful and pretty as plants. Additionally the processing needed to eat meat \(like cooking and deboning\) is more annoying than eating plants raw.	The delicious taste of meat won't last forever due to [seafood](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533125/All-seafood-will-run-out-in-2050-say-scientists.html) and [meat](http://www.quantumrun.com/prediction/vegetarians-will-reign-supreme-after-meat-shock-2035-future-food-p2) running out in the future. It's better to get used to the taste of plants than be forced to later on.	It is not clear that the additional pleasure \(if any\) of eating a meal containing meat compared to eating a meal without outweighs the suffering of the animal bred, raised and killed for their meat.	Pleasure is important to human quality of life, so if meat consumption is more pleasurable than anticipated, abstinence could have a meaningful negative impact on quality of life. The overwhelming popularity of meat throughout almost all cultures could be an indication that eating meat is enormously pleasurable.	What people commonly refer to the "taste of meat" is directly linked to one of the five basic tastes: [umami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami). This taste can also be found in vegetable foods such as miso, seaweeds, tomatoes, mushrooms and many others, thus providing an equally satisfying meal deprived of animal protein.	That the taste of meat is "pleasurable" is very subjective, and it could be argued that taste preferences can be taught and/or untaught \(trained\).	Many of man's endeavors are in pursuit of pleasure. However, some of these pleasures we derive have negative externalities, i.e. they negatively impact other people/the surrounding environment/the planet as a whole. It is in our collective interest to minimize and gradually eliminate the pursuit of such pleasures. Eating meat, though pleasurable has high impact negative externalities and should therefore be gradually eliminated. Unrestrained hedonism can be catastrophic to the commons.	Eating other animals \(human beings are animals\) is not necessary for our survival, it's for our pleasure, and this pleasure has to be balanced with the cost of the victims, which is too high \(suffering and death\).	In the most world-renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.	It is because the taste of meat is so good and popular that scientists try to imitate it and create vegetarian "meat" products.

Humans' meat consumption patterns today are not the same as those of their stone-age ancestors. Naturally, the kind of hunting and consumption of meat practised by stone-age humanoids does not, therefore, hold the same importance in modern-day culture.	Humans in industrial nations have overcome the "hunting" part of stone-age culture; there is no reason why they should not outgrow the "consumption of meat" part as well.	The [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#Subjects.2C_themes_and_patterns) found most often in cave paintings were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones. The most common animal hunting and meat consumption practices in the stone-age have not, therefore, necessarily made significant contribution to this part of human cultural history.	In our earliest origins as a species, humans needed the high amounts of energy and protein animal meat provided to power our oversized \(compared to animals\) brains. Today, in a world where food is comparatively plentiful, there is no need to turn to meat for this intake.	It would be a huge loss for humanity, if we abandoned thousands of years of culinary culture.	There are ancient vegetarian tribes, such as [Etyottydaih](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/an_ancient_vegetarian_tribe_struggles_to_keep_its_traditions_alive/).

Farm animals eat grass and animal feed, which took exactly as much CO2 out of the atmosphere during growing as the animals give back during digestion.

Vegetables are in general less \(calorie/nutrient\)-dense and therefore you need a bigger volume of them to feed people.	con	The [study](https://www.sciencealert.com/vegetarian-and-healthy-diets-may-actually-be-worse-for-the-environment-study-finds) is based on a "per-calorie" comparison, where broccoli \(34kcal/100g\) is compared to beef \(228kcal/100g\). While it is true that some vegetables are less calorie-dense, others are far more calorie-dense than meat, [beans](http://www7.slv.se/SokNaringsinnehall/Home/FoodDetails/874) for example. Beans are a more likely substitute for meat than broccoli, making vegetables less carbon-heavy.	This study did not address the fact that feeding the animals also requires massive amounts of plants and water.

the fact that meat eating and production contributes to climate change is not an argument for complete abstention from eating meat, it is only an argument for reducing the impact of meat eating, either through reduction in per capital amounts eaten or more sustainable farming practices.	3_1.1.4.8.1.1.9.2.1.1.7.1.6.1.13.

An ethical diet is not one which eliminates greenhouse gas emissions or other forms of harm; if it were, the best diet would be starvation. Instead, an ethical diet strives to balance a variety of goals; health, taste, environmental impact, cultural legacy etc. In that case, a diet which includes some meat \(but perhaps less than a typical diet in a developed country\) would be morally permissible.	The amount of land required to produce the same amount of calories is nearly 5 times greater than is required for crops. With a growing population the consumption of meat could come at a detrimental cost.

Meat should be eaten sparingly, and its externalities and environmental costs should be taken into account in its price. This will directly contribute to a higher price, and less meat consumption.

In the most world-renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.	con	If eating meat is too far abandoned before artificial replacements can suitably be found, culinary arts developed over centuries may be lost.	Something being tasty does not justify torturing animals or destroying the environment. Jeffrey Dahmer used humans as the central piece of his meals. Protecting that culinary option for him was not more important than protecting the lives of those he would destroy.	Culinary styles and traditions change and evolve over time. If the world stops eating meat, international cuisines will adapt to that fact.	Most world-renowned cuisines developed seasoning and preparations to make up for the lack of meat or mask the deficiencies of poor quality scraps. What makes them world renowned is not the meat ingredients, it's everything else around it.	Bacon. Whenever there is a debate about not eating meat, bacon is quite a strong argument for the case that eating meat brings more taste and pleasure than most plant based foods.	When meat is the main focus of a meal, it is often marinated, covered in sauces, seasonings, cheese, and vegetables to enhance its taste. It is those things that are delicious, not the meat itself.	An increase in vegetarianism would generate newer and better vegetarian foods, recipes and cooking techniques, which could rival the pleasure generated from meat-based meals.	Maybe it is not because it's the tastiest food, it could also be that it is the most exclusive, expensive and a symbol of power and wealth.	There is no necessary correlation between a particular cuisine, restaurant or dish's level of prestige and whether it includes meat or not.

Scientists have developed a so-called "[facon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_bacon)", which is a vegetarian bacon.

Until you provide artificial meat at a competitive price, people will eat animals because meat is a simple and nourishing food.	Meat "imitations" are helpful in terms of transition to vegetarianism. Experienced vegetarians do not need such products, therefore meat "imitations" are not an attempt to fill in some void in vegetarian diet.	If the taste is imitable there is no need to actually eat meat, as one can consume other vegetarian products with the same "fantastic" taste.

many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.	3_1.2.2.1.	Many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. Demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.	con	The above claim seems dependent on specific ecosystems.	The definition of 'pest' is itself a normative description that privileges human activities; e.g. kangaroos are pests because they eat crops. To hunt and kill them thus serves our own purposes, not any 'natural order.'	If it is beneficial to kill pests, then we can do that without needing to eat their meat.	Humans, as apex predators who have usurped the predatory apexes of the other predators in the ecosystems we have come to also inhabit, have an ethical responsibility to keep those ecosystems in check so that, eg, rampant deer populations do not cause deforestation and subsequent ecosystem collapse.  Even where there are populations of healthy apex predators, these populations should also be checked so they do not cause problems and kill people- and it would be unethical to waste that meat.	The majority of meat consumption is from cows, pigs, chickens, lamb, turkeys, not deer or kangaroo.	Insects are numerous and contribute to vegetable crop destruction. Humans could have a large impact on the adverse effects of insects by eating them.	The morality of hunting is irrelevant to whether farming is bad for the environment.	The context of this argument \(this specific sub-point\) is directly related to farming, not hunting animals. Proposing an argument of benefits of hunting overpopulated animals is a misrepresentation of the argument.

There is [far less land](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/facts-on-animal-farming-and-the-environment/) where only and exclusively livestock can be raised than there is agricultural land where plant foods can grow.

There are new [methods](http://www.bbc.com/future/sponsored/story/20170227-remote-control-farming) of farming \([hydroponics](https://bigpictureeducation.com/hydroponics-and-future-farming), etc\) that allow us to grow crops indoors or on the land where there was previously nothing at all, or just livestock.	Some level of animal husbandry is an integral part of a farm's nutrients cycle: from grass, to manure, to fertilizer. In alpine regions, where no crops grow, animals do not only increase the efficiency of the land but often are the most efficient way to use it to produce food. Thus, based on these two reasons, there is a justified level of animal husbandry \(which is far below current level\).

Many approaches to farming plants leads to monocultural agriculture practices that have a harmful impact on the wider environment.	con	Industrial, monoculture based, factory farmed meat is indeed bad in many ways. However, it represents only one failed model of agriculture. [Permaculture based farming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13412-015-0254-8) with strategic rotational grazing programs, have been shown to create many positive and vital ecological outcomes as well as improved ethics. Meat production, done in this manner, provides a very real and powerful tool in battling climate change, erosion, pollination and habitat loss, loss of bio diversity, and lack of soil health.	The problem is not meat eating, but agriculture. Growing corn, soy and wheat is incredibly destructive to our environment, to the soil. Nature's only sustainable food supply is herbivores on grasslands. The herbivore stimulates grass. The grass sequesters carbon. The meat of the herbivore is nutrient dense. Human beings participated in this natural cycle for 2 million years before the industrial revolution.	Farming plants often has a similarly severe environmental impact. Humans no longer live in an agrarian culture where every family can farm for their own sustenance, so this ecological impact is a function of human civilization itself, not our choice of diet between plants and animals specifically.	Meat animals can convert byproducts and waste that are not valuable for food into something humans can eat.	Not if done responsibly and with a particular focus on agricultural sustainability. If real farmers can take back the market from big-farma and work cohesively and symbiotically this is a very plausible potential.	The increasing demand for vegetables is causing deforestation in places like South America and Africa[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_farming)	The vegetable products used to create "fake" meat protein are typically soy and wheat-based, contributing to the threat that exists due to agricultural monoculture.	Feeding the planet on a vegetarian diet alone involves a heavy reliance on industrial monocrop agriculture.  Monocultural farms are more harmful to the environment than polycultural farms that grow a mix of plants and animals in a way that mirrors the natural ecosystem.  Polycultural farms only achieve the necessary output levels when you include the animal calories.  In terms of net animal life death, these polycultural farms cause lower loss of animal life than industrial monocultures.	This argument is highly dependent on "how" we raise animals. Many of the arguments in this thread are based on one small understanding of one single model of farming \(monocultural based industrial farming\). But there are other, more ecologically and productive models of raising meat. If we stay on course, your argument holds up. But if we shift to more permaculture based models of farming it does not.	Animal agriculture contributes to an environmentally, socially and financially balanced agricultural system, with mixed feed and food crops, nutritionally diverse diets, reduced inputs and closed nutrient cycles, and a balance of operating risk from diversification.	These same monocultural practices are also used to produce food for animals, thus creating a double impact. Cutting one half of this double impact would still reduce its impact.	The recycling of animal manures is an essential part of growing crops. The removal of this sorce of natural fertilizer would have a detrimental effect economically and environmentally on crop production and it would leave us totally dependent on artificial fertilisers.

ceasing to eat meat would harm the economy.	3_1.3.	Ceasing to eat meat would harm the economy.	con	Breeding livestock is necessary for many people \(particularly farmers\) to survive. Stopping this will eliminate their foundation of life.	Intensive livestock farming is economically bad for small farmers.	Whether or not something is good for the economy does not impact whether it is morally acceptable.	Keynesian economic theory deals pretty well with large fluctuations in commodities.	Ceasing to produce meat would be extremely harmful to low-income countries.	If the externalities of meat were properly priced in, meat production would be far less economically efficient than the production of crops.	Systems-based agricultural models are often reliant on meat production, both as an ecological service and money maker. Ceasing meat production would limit those farmers from receiving both those benefits.	Animal agriculture is an important part of local food economies in cold climates where many crops are not available year-round.	If subsidies related to farming animals were removed, the demand for meat would decrease due to higher prices and lower supply; allowing for reduction in meat consumption without a very unpopular and difficult to regulate law.	In the short term, yes. In the long term not ceasing to waste land and continuing to emit massive amounts of unnecessary greenhouse gasses will incur devastating economic consequences.  Beyond this, optimizing the use of water and ending subsidies for animal agriculture would encourage inevitable growth in other sectors, something which companies like Best Foods have been [compelled to accept](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-hellmanns-vegan-mayonnaise-20160202-story.html) and are now making vegan mayonnaise after losing their lawsuit over eggless Just Mayo.	Living beings should not be treated as commodities. It would be considered to be dehumanizing if applied to humans, and I believe similar emotional disconnection and distancing even from animals is a bad idea which leads to undesirable results \(abuses, desensitization to all harm including that done to humans, etc.\).	The economic impact may be manageable - it would not be the first time an industry has wound down, or been shut down or suppressed.	Meat keeps food prices high \(due to supply and demand\). With meat taking resources, such as land and water, the food supply is limited for consumers, which pushes the prices higher for food. [This is good for the economy because if food prices go too low, farmers run into difficulties covering their costs.](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/micro_price-floor.php)	Meat raises food prices for consumers. Livestock eat grains, which drives up demand for them.	Many people across the world depend on meat as part of their diet, and ending meat eating would lower food security/diversity for the majority of people.	Most of what we consume and buy today comes from animal production. It's not only about meat, it also concerns eggs, feathers, leather, but also candy. Stopping the production of meat will impact much more than the "Meat industry", and have a huge impact on global economy	Ceasing to eat meat would increase the economy. Exporting the grains fed to livestock in the US would increase the trade balance by $80 billion. [news.cornell.edu](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat)	This is an advantage as financial pressure is a force for change.	Global meat production is constantly [rising](http://www.worldwatch.org/global-meat-production-and-consumption-continue-rise-1). Worldwide meat production has tripled over the last four decades and increased 20% in just the last 10 years. This causes more jobs as the industry expands.	Slavery was the backbone of the economy in the past. Slavery was defended by economic interests throughout the life of human civilization until the time of the Industrial Revolution. From today's point of view, advocating slavery with economic interests seems absurd, and it can also be associated with the enslavement of other creatures.	Restricting or replacing meat leads to projects that, with the help of state-of-the-art sciences, create [innovative solutions](http://web.unep.org/championsofearth/laureates/2018/impossible-foods-and-beyond-meat) that [drive society](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/tackling-worlds-most-urgent-problem-meat) in many ways \(economic, moral, environmental, health, jobs, technology etc.\).	According to a study, less meat would come with [economic benefits](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/15/4146.abstract) due to lower [healthcare costs](https://web.archive.org/web/20080517050751/http://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02/) and fewer lost workdays associated with deaths from specific diseases caused by poor diet, adding up to an impressive savings of between $700 and $1,000 billion annually.

something that is not morally acceptable for one person may be morally acceptable for another. suggesting that eating meat is morally unacceptable completely negates human history and the fact that, at one point, we needed to sustain off of it. however, this is not to say that there aren't more humane ways to treat cattle / livestock.	3_1.3.3.3.

Immoral things, or things now considered to be immoral, were once widely accepted in the past \(e.g. slavery\). This does not "negate history". Therefore, it is plausible that eating meat will come to be considered immoral \(by more people, and perhaps society in general\) in the future.	Depending on the moral system used, morality can depend on the situation.

Insofar as stopping meat production helps alleviate climate change, it is beneficial for the economies of low-income countries.	Low-income countries suffer from malnutrition and food shortages. Since ceasing to eat meat would allow us to produce more food, this would benefit low-income countries.	A lot of food produced in poorer countries is for the consumption of livestock which is then imported as meat to the west. This food could be be used to directly feed people in low income countries.	The farming of animals for meat can be problematic.  For example, when the practice involves using land to produce food for animals at the expense of food for people.  However, I stayed in poor villages in Indonesia where pigs and chickens were fed scraps or scratched for grubs.  Those chickens and pigs did not take any food that was otherwise edible for people and I felt OK to eat the meat they produced.	Countless small farmers make a living from raising chickens, goats and other animals for meat.  If artificial meat supplants that industry it will be just more wealth accumulating to the corporate techie elite.	Many bioregions are incapable of supporting one human let alone whole societies without the use of animals as a necessary part of the foodchain.

Growth in the meat sector is simply due to growing demand for food. When people transition to other food, this demand will allow other sectors to grow instead.	The idea of the possibility of constant growth is wrong. It is not possible to constantly grow the meat industry, because we live on a limited planet. Therefore what happened in the past cannot be extrapolated into the future just like that.	The meat substitutes industry can grow to replace the meat industry, taking jobs from the meat industry and creating new ones.

eating meat is a central part of human nature, evolution, and physiology/biology and thus its consumption is inherent to humankind.	3_1.4.	Eating meat is a central part of human nature, evolution, and physiology/biology and thus its consumption is inherent to humankind.	con	Buying and consuming processed meat from intensive livestock farming is anything but natural.	[Eating](https://askentomologists.com/2015/02/11/journey-through-time/) insects is equally part of human nature but was abandoned by some parts of humanity.	Just like other conceptions of what is natural, the idea of eating meat as being natural is socially constructed and subject to change.	There is no reason to assume that a natural lifestyle is essential \(healthwise or morally\), as there are plenty of reasons for humans to follow an "unnatural" lifestyle.	Meat has historically been both valuable for our technological progression, and necessary to continued human existence, it is not clear that that value has ended.	Moving from the consumption of meat in totality would signal a move from prioritizing our biological predispositions, as highly adapted persistence hunters, towards an emphasis on valuation of all life without regard for the occupied stratum of consciousness of the consumed. This is contradictory because of the difficulty in the determination of self-awareness of many types and complexities of life-forms, plants included, thus creating a difficulty in the determination of an objective boundary.	As almost everyone who discusses "human nature" only includes what they prefer not to be debated in this concept, the "human nature" argument is not objective, and there is no evidence to suggest there is a "human nature".	Just because something comes naturally to humans, it does not mean it is the correct decision to do it.	If societal instability becomes the norm and we have lost the traditions and knowledge on animal husbandry and meat preservation it will result in mass casualties within the human family.	Being that we're classified as omnivores, consuming meat would best be described as functional and significant, but not "central" to our existence.	There are many other things which could be argued to be "a central part of human nature and biology and thus inherent to humankind" which we do not \(continue to\) do.	Arguing that eating meat is human nature and inherent to humanity is the "appeal to nature" fallacy. [yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature)	The brain's circuits are designed to generate behaviour that is appropriate to our survival. Generally, beings find things tasty that their system needs, as the brain tells them [unconsciously](https://books.google.de/books?id=nkPj3dNFYwoC&redir_esc=y). Thus we can conclude: meat tastes good because it is useful.	The [consumption](http://www.livescience.com/24875-meat-human-brain.html) of \(cooked\) meat was crucial for the development of the human brain. Therefore you can state that eating meat is what made humans what they are today.	Humans have not evolved to hunt, eat or digest meat very successfully.	Low retention rates among vegetarians could be an indication that the majority of people cannot consistently abstain from eating meat. If the larger number of humans are unable to abstain from eating meat than asking them to would contradict the categorical imperative. If this contradiction does exist than it can not be unethical, or "wrong" to eat meat. [skeptoid.com/lapsed-vegetarians-or-return-of-the-meat-eaters/](http://skeptoid.com/blog/2011/10/16/lapsed-vegetarians-or-return-of-the-meat-eaters/)	Human life is unsustainable in many regions of the world without consuming meat. Without agricultural capitalism, humans can only survive without meat in warm climates with bountiful fruits and vegetables to gather.	If eating meat is wrong, then 78.2% of Humanity [\(which is the 100% of human population minus the estimated 21.8 of vegetarians\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country#Demographics) i.e. 5.4 billion people are wrong.

Or, it is sold to veal farming, which is inherently cruel \(I can explain further if needed\). If a calf is female, it's stolen away from the mother and not allowed to drink any of the milk, because the milk must be sold for money for humans.

From a natural perspective: In the global ecosystem \(and any smaller one\) death is of equal importance to life. Animals rarely die of old age because they are still within the food chain. If they did the ecosystem would be severely unstable. Predators must kill to survive and keep populations in check that might otherwise reduce important plant numbers. They're a necessary part of the balance.	You assume that we are "highly adapted hunters" which is not true. Being technologically advanced so we can hunt is not the same as saying we are good hunters. Having a very good capacity of reasoning and abstractization makes you a good hunter as well as it makes you a good anything else. Using our intellect as humans we could easily bypass our so called "need" for meat. Also, being hard to determine is not the same thing as being contradictory.	There is no "objective boundary" between good and evil. All boundaries are subjective and are yet no less compulsory as such. To assume that we need an objective boundary to make ethical decisions problematizes ethics into circuity.	As a species we are good hunters, not only as a result of our superb reasoning skills, but because of possession of many biological  adaptations, which are specific to carnivorous animals.

From an 'unnatural' or human perspective: The farming of animals is not contingent on our natural dispositions.

No. A bully beating up a weaker kid to feel powerful is acting according to human nature too. Gorging on high-calorie food is acting according to human nature.

as animals lack rights, it is morally permissible to raise them for slaughter.	3_1.5.	As animals lack rights, it is morally permissible to raise them for slaughter.	con	Animals are unable to conceptualise of morality therefore they do not deserve to exist within our moral community.	The fact that humans have developed to a greater extent than animals means that they should have the ability to use animals for their own ends.	Humans should not have the authority to make decisions about animals given we do not have perfect information about their experiences.	Unlike wild animals, farmed animals are born explicitly due to human action. While we may have a duty to ensure that their lives are not unnecessarily cruel, it is not immoral to kill them for our own ends given they would not have existed otherwise.	Animals should have rights because they are sentient beings.	Eating meat violates animals' right to life.	Animals do in fact have rights. Many forms of cruelty are explicitly outlawed. One cannot, for instance, torture a dog for years in their basement. Therefore the statement that animals do not have rights is fundamentally false.	Rights by their nature correspond to duties. Since the actions of animals lack moral content they can't be said to have duties; we don't talk about a tiger or a cow being morally good or bad, or assign moral obligations to them, because by their nature they are not rational beings.	Animals not having rights doesn't imply in any way that killing and torturing them for our consumption is moral.	Animals lack free will.	There is no trait that makes animals different than humans that if the same logic were applied to a human, it would justify farming that human as meat.	Animals are only given rights by us. If we were, as a society, to say that animals don’t have rights then they wouldn’t have rights. Ethics aren’t inherent for beings that aren’t capable of complex thought. A dog is only able to understand that the rumble in their stomach means they’re hungry — they can’t contemplate whether or not they truly exist or what it means to know something.	Rights are socially constructed by fallible and limited humans. Animals not having enforced 'rights' does not mean that it is okay to do anything to animals, only that the humans in a position of power creating rights did not think it worthwhile to give them rights.	From a utilitarian metric, life itself has no value, but rather the emotions experienced in life is what matters. The way we harvest animals is considerably less painful than how a vast majority of animals will die naturally — such as being slowly torn apart by their predators.	Historically, there have been times when certain categories of humans did not ‘have rights.’ Many of those rights were denied due to a supposed ‘inferiority’ to groups in power, who possessed ‘rights.’ In some cases, those humans were born explicitly for exploitation. We now regognize how wrong those policies are and have been working past the problematic moral dilemmas and inequities these policies caused. It’s a moral imperative that we do the same with other species.	Rights are inalienable and "endowed by our creator". They are not given just by law which why it is morally defensible to challenge laws that attempt to deny rights. Even though current law does not give rights to animals, it does not mean that animals do not have them under the principles through which the concept of rights was created.	In most religions, animals lack souls/spirits, putting them decisively into a different moral category than humans, permitting a different set of ethics.	Animals don't lack rights, and even if they did, they shouldn't. We should consider cruelty to animals immoral for the same reason we consider cruelty to humans immoral. It is an affront to the empathy we share with living beings.
animals are unable to conceptualise of morality therefore they do not deserve to exist within our moral community.	3_1.5.1.	Animals are unable to conceptualise of morality therefore they do not deserve to exist within our moral community.	con	Animals do not offer rights to one another. Animals hurt and eat one another.	All and only human beings have the [capacity to reason](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/regan01.htm). This is a definite feature of moral judgement. As animals lack this ability they are not morally equivalent.	Animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights.	By this logic babies, little children as well as severely mentally disabled people cannot be possessors of rights either. But that would be wrong.	Nonhuman animals are unable to engage in sophisticated moral reasoning. Therefore, nonhuman animals cannot be held to sophisticated moral standards. Humans on the other hand can engage in sophisticated moral reasoning. Therefore, humans can be held to sophisticated moral standards. This includes standards about how we should or should not behave towards nonhuman animals.	Animals can conceptualize morals. Dogs and monkeys, for example, have a concept of fairness. Experiments have been done where two monkeys \(or dogs\) are given different treats for the same trick and those receiving the lesser treat for the same work will become agitated, angry or refuse the treat, even though one bad treat should be better than none.	Animals act on instinct and cannot deliberate between actions, therefore they have no moral status. For example, a tiger cannot be made to stand at court for killing a man, neither can a dog. If they can have no regard for human, we cannot have any regard for them. Therefore we can kill animals for food.	Humans don't have a moral responsibility to those who they don't think would exhibit the same moral responsibility were they in the same position. You have moral responsibility to a child because they will one day be an adult and you can reasonably expect them to treat you morally. I do not expect cows to have morals besides not being pointlessly sadistic. They would eat me if they could and were hungry, so I feel no qualms about eating them.	You are not required to be a moral subject in order to become a moral object. Utilitarism, for instance, is not based on the ability to conceptualise right or wrong but by the ability to feel pain or pleasure.

Domestication was a "social contract" between the two species: humans obtained a mobile source of food and cloth and the animals were assured basic necessities and protection from natural predators and a guaranteed way to spread their genes. In the present, domesticated animals can be considered the most "successful" species, with 0 probability of becoming extinct, while many "free" wild animals starve and are less able to reproduce.	To not eat an animal who dedicated it's entire life so that it can be consumed is not only wasteful but disrespectful towards that animal's sacrifice to sustain us.
as long as these animals are given a reasonable quality of life, it is preferable that they get the opportunity to exist given to them by humans for the purpose of farming. in the alternative, many animals do not get to exist at all.	3_1.5.4.1.	As long as these animals are given a reasonable quality of life, it is preferable that they get the opportunity to exist given to them by humans for the purpose of farming. In the alternative, many animals do not get to exist at all.	con	People who don't eat meat give animals a better quality of life while avoiding the majority of conditions and situations that are caused by meat producing farmers. Thus, the terms of existence are better managed by the people that consider sentience above digestion. Most noticeably, the inferior existence and situation is massively created by industrially breeding domesticated animals into being.	Bringing an entity into existence does not mean that you have the ability to use that entity for whatever purpose you want.
this is because humans have special, higher-order rights - for example, a right to freedom. animals do not have these rights, so it is permissible to breed them for certain uses.	3_1.5.4.3.1.	This is because humans have special, higher-order rights - for example, a right to freedom. Animals do not have these rights, so it is permissible to breed them for certain uses.	con	Human rights only emerged through generations of human individuals failing to seek or achieve those rights. Rights are achieved by ending oppression. As exemplified by historical freedom stories, the worthiness of animals for rights is the matter under examination when weighing the morality of killing them for food.	Animals don't lack rights, and even if they did, they shouldn't. We should consider cruelty to animals immoral for the same reason we consider cruelty to humans immoral. It is an affront to the empathy we share with living beings.

this is an anthropomorphic analogy.  it is a trait of human psychology and one in this case which is incorrect.  comparing a human child to a feed lot animal is unbalanced in value. a feed lot animal if left in it's natural condition consumes plants and in turn is consumed by other animals. if humans were not eating them they would be eaten by other predators/scavengers in the wild. their condition in life does not change much between feed lot and field.	3_1.5.4.3.2.

If humans were not eating them they would be eaten by other predators/scavengers in the wild. Their condition in life does not change much between feed lot and field.	con	Boredom \(such as that caused by monotonous, unchanging, restricted enclosures\) can also be suffering, and can cause stress or frustration in animals \(which can in turn lead to them attacking each other, especially when enclosures are also too small\). At the very least, it reduces the quality of their lives.	As discussed earlier, these animals are bred specifically for human consumption. If humans had not created these animals, they could not possibly "be eaten by other predators/scavengers in the wild."	"Unbalanced in value" is dubious. By what objective measure of value are you using? You are basing the value of a life on their potential to achieve some human-centric measure of worth. A feral human left in the wild, or a mentally handicapped child, is of equal value to a penned sheep then.	Who is to argue when anthropomorphising is or isn't wrong? Blacks were enslaved because they were just brutes. Then one day we anthropomorphised them. Voila, suddenly rights are bestowed.	Animals in the wild have freedom of movement and other increased choices not available to farm animals. Quality of life is not decided purely by length or absence of suffering, or how its end is met.	For this statement to be true every animal which is prey would end their lives at the hands of a predator. In fact most survive to experience a natural cause of death.	Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to animals. There is no such attribution in the claim.
many indigenous peoples had broad arts, culture, and tradition, and sophisticated societies involving living in harmony with the land, other animals, and each other. often this was a reasoned process developed and passed down through generations \(much like our own technology!\), not merely instinctual. deliberately moderating your group's consumption in the name of sustainability, for instance, is hardly a "brutish" trait or culture. it is not "anthropomorphizing" to recognize genuine virtues.	3_1.5.4.3.2.4.1.

if we cease eating meat then millions of animals will never be born at all. we cannot be certain that animals would prefer to never be born than to die prematurely.	3_1.5.4.4.	If we cease eating meat then millions of animals will never be born at all. We cannot be certain that animals would prefer to never be born than to die prematurely.	con	An animal that isn't born can't prefer to be born at all as they don't exist. An animal that exists currently doesn't want to die prematurely \(they actively avoid pain\). Since we know they don't want to die \(avoid pain\) it is ethical not to harm them. If we create animals to kill \(harm\) we are acting unethically.	It is true that animal intelligence exists and should be considered no matter where it scores relative to ours. Since we do not know if they prefer to live a little before being killed, we should not assume they would, especially because factory farming living conditions are not even good in the first place.

The relationship between domesticated animals and their human captures is not a mutually beneficial relationship. Animals raised for slaughter are artificially selected for traits that humans value, which inhibit the animal's ability to survive in the wild. Each of our domesticated species suffers from various illnesses and conditions that are a direct result of captivity and human exploitation.

To not eat an animal who dedicated it's entire life so that it can be consumed is not only wasteful but disrespectful towards that animal's sacrifice to sustain us.	con	The goal of not eating meat is not to help an animal that has already been slaughtered, but to reduce demand and thus production of meat in the long term.	The animal has not made a choice to dedicate it's life to humankind nor has it chosen to sacrifice itself to sustain us. We have made the choice to kill it.
animals do not conceive of pain and death the same way humans do.	3_1.5.5.1.	Animals do not conceive of pain and death the same way humans do.	con	The experience of pain is confounded by the conscious knowledge that pain is being inflicted with intent. Without consciousness pain lacks the existential terror of deliberative motive and merely becomes an unpleasant sensation.	In order to feel pain, one must have some kind of consciousness, because he knows how to distinguish himself from the world. Its like: "It's me who feel pain", and not this stone or this other dog. One must have some kind of conscience of his body in-the-world, in order to feel pain.	Most animals do not have preferences about their own futures, like humans do. It is therefore not wrong to kill them.	Animals will generally attempt to avoid pain \(and often become distressed when they believe it is impending, such as during veterinary visits\), suggesting that they do not wish to experience it.

the pleasure of a human is worth more than the life of an animal because it is scarcer. thus, utilitarian ethics suggest that humans should keep eating meat.	3_1.5.5.2.1.	The pleasure of a human is worth more than the life of an animal because it is scarcer. Thus, utilitarian ethics suggest that humans should keep eating meat.	con	From a human perspective it is easy to produce more animals but difficult to create pleasure. Comparing the two, this makes pleasure more valuable to humans than animal lives.	Billions of animals are brutalized and tortured on factory farms every year. Since the only pleasure humans get from eating meat is gustatory pleasure, it is doubtful that the pain and suffering that these animals experience can ever be justified according to utilitarian principles.	It is not necessarily true that human pleasure is scarce. People find many ways to experience pleasure, through spending time with loved ones, participating in hobbies and watching media entertainment. There are likely also other foods humans can eat to experience pleasure without relying on meat.	Human pleasure evaporates quickly while an animal life is lost forever. These after effects make an animal life worth more.

There are many other ways for humans to get joy that do not require the suffering of animals e.g. spending time with loved ones, participating in hobbies and sports, and eating other food they enjoy that does not include animal products. This means joy is not a good reason for eating meat.

Humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the sublimation of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner. Animals are not, thus they are unequal to humans on a moral level.	con	Plenty of researchers would disagree and argue that moral and ethical behavior can be observed in animals, for example [Frans de Waal](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/the-bonobo-and-the-atheist/) as well as [Marc Bekoff and Jessice Pierce](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo6407651.html).	Some humans are not capable of culture, innovation, or sublimation of instinct, and are thus not able to act in an ethical manner \(i.e cognitive disability\), but we still consider their interests morally relevant.	This does not excuse cruelty or unnecessary harm.	For any supposed capacity that humans possess and animals lack, and in virtue of which humans but not animals are taken to have rights, some humans will lack that capacity and some animals may possess that capacity. For instance, humans generally have the ability to reason, while most animals lack this capacity. But this cannot be the basis on which humans have and animals lack rights, because certain humans, including young infants, lack the ability to reason and certain animals may have it.	Animals are able to suppress their instincts, something that, for example, dog training aims at.

Thus, there is a difference in the logic applied.	As noted in the linked article, plants are able to survive losing a large portion of their biomass - and many produce fruiting bodies deliberately intended for consumption by animals - whereas harvesting an animal for meat kills it 100% of the time. It is more possible to ethically harvest \(some\) plants than animals.	Farming animals for meat requires either farming plants for their food, or allowing them to graze in deliberately altered semi-natural environments. Therefore, farming meat produces a greater utilitarian loss than farming plants, as farming plants only harms and kills plants directly, while farming meat harms and kills both plants and the animals.

With that logic, eating plants, fruits or vegetables also violates their right to life. There is nothing wrong with the occurrence of natural selection and the circle of life.	con	Fruiting plants' fruiting bodies are deliberately grown to be removed and eaten in order to spread the plant's seeds, and are not essential to its individual survival. Fruiting plants are easily capable of withstanding the loss of nutrients which go into producing fruit and continuing to thrive, while killing an animal for meat outright ends that animal's life permanently.	There is no "natural selection" occurring on a farm in any case unless certain animals are deliberately spared the harvest for specific reasons, and/or deliberately used to breed - and even then, this is preferential breeding and not natural selection. Animals born and bred on farms are not naturally occurring specimens.	"Their right to life" implies a personhood which isn't a characteristic the scientific community agrees plants have. The correct phrase is "its right to life", which plants don't have.

rights by their nature correspond to duties. since the actions of animals lack moral content they can't be said to have duties; we don't talk about a tiger or a cow being morally good or bad, or assign moral obligations to them, because by their nature they are not rational beings.	3_1.5.8.

The claim that animals are not rational beings is debated. This book gives an overview of the different studies on animal rationality and interpretations of the term rationality [philpapers.org](https://philpapers.org/rec/HURRA). Since it is not clear that animals are not rational beings, you cannot just assume their actions lack moral content. And even if their actions lacked moral content to them, this might not be the case for us, as human beings interpreting their behaviour.	Humans should not predate other species for the sake of it, only as and when it's out of necessity.	No one argued the moral onus to not eat meat was on the animals. We as humans have rights and therefore duties.	The claim that animals don't have rights, because rights equate with duty is an outdated one made by Kant, Descartes, and others. We now have greater insight- and more questions- about animal intelligence and the nature of consciousness in general, so can no longer hold these claims as valid arguments.	People should treat things \(other humans, animals, plants, or minerals\) according to their natures. It is natural for a prey animal to be eaten, and so there is nothing immoral in eating it.	Rights correspond to duties that moral agents have towards the holder of rights, not necessarily duties that the holder of rights has.	Rights are based on the ability to suffer, not on the ability to think rationally.	By this logic we should be able to eat severely mentally disabled people or the insane, since many of them are incapable of acting with moral content \(which is why they often can not be held criminally liable for their actions\). Clearly that would be immoral. For the same reasons, this argument is flawed.	The rights of animals can correspond to the duties of humans, but not to duties of other animals.

It is natural for a prey animal to be eaten, and so there is nothing immoral in eating it.	con	No "prey" animal is eaten by its own nature, rather because other animals evolve to prey on it.	Morality is not predicated upon the nature of or actions of others.	Humans treat all sorts of things unnaturally: for example, using animal products to create glue, or minerals to create computers. Clearly humans have the capacity to go beyond a thing's "natural purpose."	All life suffers, and all life dies. Furthermore, all life inevitably results in the suffering and death of other life. Competition for food and habitat, predation, competition to reproduce...all of this happens even without human influence, even in microbial ecosystems. So the logical conclusion of this claim is that life itself is cruel and immoral. It is a spiritual, subjective, and therefore unsubstantiated claim. One cannot possibly know the truth.	When most humans see slaughter houses, they feel [discomfort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOBWoAwCQyk&has_verified=1) whereas if a carnivore animal saw one they'd feel hunger and likely attempt to eat the animal there and then. Therefore it can no longer be considered our nature to treat animals as prey or act as if we are instinctually predators.

Modern medicine would rather put an egg on his face. Any claim that certain knowledge is impossible to possess is one which should be viewed with scepticism, as there is no knowledge which is arbitrarily and absolutely incomprehensible.	Suffering is unpleasant, and all sufficiently conscious animals attempt to avoid it. \(Even less conscious animals reflexively avoid pain!\) This suggests it is something we should not deliberately inflict, and take reasonable steps to avoid inflicting in others, as well as avoiding ourselves. Even if we cannot perfect the world, we should attempt to improve it.	If life only produced suffering and negative experiences, this argument may hold water. However, life also produces joy and pleasure and enjoyable experiences. As such, according to [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) and similar ethical theories, our "job" or at least the most moral courses of action are to minimize suffering while maximizing pleasure and pleasant experiences.	This claim is invoking moral skepticism - there is no objective basis for wrong and right. Holding this position is extremely impractical as it permits all human behaviour and it follows that actions such as murder and rape- both observable in non-human life- are acceptable. In reality, this is not the case. Human behaviour is governed by norms whose content is subjective but whose existence  is not. Subjective though it may be, we accept that there are principles of right and wrong.

As a human, we know that we make choices and we also see each other making choices. Animals, by contrast, mostly seem to be biotic machines, always trying to get the components they need to run, and spread.	Many animals have demonstrated free will through play, associations and affections with humans and other animals, and more. Anyone who has owned a cat can attest that animals demonstrate free will; dolphins and primates also frequently exhibit it.	Because something lacks 'free will', does not mean it is incapable of suffering.	Without evidence, it could just as easily be stated that humans also lack free will, leaving all factors equal on this standpoint.	Assuming humans have free will, there's just as much reason to believe some animals do as well. Many of them have highly complex minds and problem-solving ability, crows being a good example. Contrary to popular belief, pigs are also highly intelligent.	Speciesism is the ideology that one species is 'better than' another simply because they view their species specific abilities as inherently more valueable than that of another species. Many humans view cognition as the valuable human attribute that raises the value of our species above that of other animals, however, each animal contributes to the health and well-being of the planet in their own unique way, and it is impossible to categorize one characteristic as more valuable than the next.	There is no "moral" way to kill an innocent animal who thinks, feels and wants to live — just like humans do.

from a utilitarian metric, life itself has no value, but rather the emotions experienced in life is what matters. the way we harvest animals is considerably less painful than how a vast majority of animals will die naturally — such as being slowly torn apart by their predators.	3_1.5.14.	From a utilitarian metric, life itself has no value, but rather the emotions experienced in life is what matters. The way we harvest animals is considerably less painful than how a vast majority of animals will die naturally — such as being slowly torn apart by their predators.	con	Keeping animals for slaughtering is a lot more humane then letting them die through natural ways such as predation, starvation or disease.	It is not just how an animal dies that matters, but how it lives. A free life, even one with a \(temporarily\) painful end, is arguably preferable to a life in a cage, especially when some of the more barbaric and cruel factory farming practices \(de-beaking, other forms of un-anaesthetized mutilation, insufficient health care to prevent diseases from spreading across the herd, etc.\) come into play.	The consumption of prey animals by humans is significantly more humane in comparison to how these creatures are hunted and ripped apart in the wild by their natural predators. Refusing to eat meat does NOT prevent brutal, bloody or painful animal death.  Human consumption of meat in fact reduces that pain and suffering by ensuring the creatures are clean, healthy and unspoiled before being humanely killed for later consumption.	Beeing kept in narrow spaces and very likely has a negative utilitarian value. The utilitarian value of nonexistence is neutral. Since the animals we eat exist specifically for this purpose, not eating meat would lead to a neutral utilitarian value instead of a negative value.	Life has a high amount of value in utilitarian terms because prematurely dying means not being able to experience the positive emotions you would otherwise. The prematurely short lives of animals raised just to maturity for meat is probably a larger utility loss than how they end up dying.	Utilitarianism is not the most valid measure of moral value. Often, principles such as "killing is wrong" are considered to be a moral law despite the fact that this may lead to higher level of happiness.
keeping animals for slaughtering is a lot more humane then letting them die through natural ways such as predation, starvation or disease.	3_1.5.14.1.	Keeping animals for slaughtering is a lot more humane then letting them die through natural ways such as predation, starvation or disease.	con	Other animals eat animals too. For humans, as for these animals, it is therefore only natural.	Indeed, keeping animals for slaughter who never knew freedom or happiness is arguably more ethical than capturing free beings in the wild with painful traps, no regard for offspring/mates, and potential waste. Not to mention the effect on the ecosystem of free-range hunting in the quantities currently demanded.	It is not just how an animal dies that matters, but how it lives. A free life, even one with a \(temporarily\) painful end, is arguably preferable to a life in a cage, especially when some of the more barbaric and cruel factory farming practices \(de-beaking, other forms of un-anaesthetized mutilation, insufficient health care to prevent diseases from spreading across the herd, etc.\) come into play.	Eating animals that have been raised in a responsible environment and killed humanely offers a better life than most ever obtain from living wild.	Healthy farm animals fit into a healthy farm system like wild animals fit into a wild ecosystem. In domesticating live stock we have created animals that are most comfortable in agricultural \(rather than wild\) conditions.	It is not just that humans keep animals for slaughtering, but that they produce animals for the specific purpose of slaughtering and eating them. Without the meat industry, these animals would not need to be bred in such numbers and less animals would be killed.	While we should aim to reduce and eventually eliminate the suffering of animals, vegetarianism is a tacit demand for the extinction of all domesticated animals used for food. If an animal living in the wild were given the choice of being guaranteed food, shelter, and procreation knowing that their eventual demise would be painless and provide their ancestors a similar lifestyle, they would likely agree to live under those conditions rather than suffer in the wild.	If we did not raise animals for meat, those farm animals would not exist in the wild; rather, they would simply not exist.	We are not morally culpable for the deaths of animals in the wild. By contrast, we are morally culpable for suffering we deliberately inflict.	Not keeping an animal at all is therefore even "more humane" compared to both of these options. We should therefore, as intelligent beings, choose the best option possible and not keep animals at all, since we don`t need to do so.

Humans do not depend on killing and eating animals for their survival, and certainly not through the mass-breeding of animals with the sole purpose of killing them.	No one suggests that it is wrong for lions and carnivores and non-human omnivores to eat meat, because they are part of nature. Since humans are also part of nature, if an individual wants to eat meat, that should also be considered natural \(eg. similar to a Chimpanzee eating a gazelle, etc.\)	Humans are animals and they have the right to eat what they feel they need to eat.

In contrast to other animals, they prefer them dismembered and with other foods at the same time, not freshly killed and oftentimes not raw.	If "other animals eat animals" then that suggests its ok for humans to eat humans too.	Humans have not evolved to hunt, eat or digest meat very successfully.	The transfer of vital energy from one being to another is no human invention but nature's concept.

That animals eat other animals is the natural order of the world; to replicate and continue this is not immoral.	con	Just like other animals, it is simply part of the food chain for us to eat meat.	Morality is best described as an ideal way "to be." This coincides with natural law. The most basic natural law seems to be that a system must adapt to subjugate other less-adapted systems \(eat or be eaten\). All moral systems are subservient to this basic universal morality. Thinking we may or should transcend that construct, when we are, ourselves, products of it, reeks of hubris.	Every organism on earth dies or is killed at some point, so other organisms can live. This is how nature works.	Keeping animals for slaughtering is a lot more humane then letting them die through natural ways such as predation, starvation or disease.	People should treat things \(other humans, animals, plants, or minerals\) according to their natures. It is natural for a prey animal to be eaten, and so there is nothing immoral in eating it.	As humans are animals the logical extension of this is that humans should be allowed to kill each other without consequences. Clearly we have progressed beyond such fatalism.	Humans, as the dominant species on Earth, have transcended the natural order in countless ways. We are no longer required to kill to survive and so have no excuse for not taking on higher moral obligations.	There is nothing natural about factory farming and caging, controlling, and herding "prey" animals on a day to day basis. This cannot be argued to be treating said "prey" animals "according to their natures".	Many natural things, like murder, rape, or leaving offspring to die are deeply immoral. The consumption of meat is immoral on similar grounds.	If we are concerned about the death and harm of animals the logical extension of this care is to do as much as possible to prevent animals from dying in the wild. That we don't do so supports the idea we accept that this natural dynamic of predator-prey is not always overridden by animal welfare concerns.	It may be natural for reflectively rational creatures like humans to become aware of the consequences of their actions and to abstain from doing things like eating meat.	Humankind has exceeded 8 billion individuals in size. this achievement was possible due to unnatural mechanisms. Humankind has not followed the natural order \(at least\) since the industrial revolution. The concept of morality today is different from the concept of morality in pre-historic times.	If predation is the natural order of the world, then humans should actually predate rather than blindly consuming meat from sources they are not familiar with. Humans desiring to eat meat should go into the wild, kill the wild animal, and then consume it. However, many people are more comfortable with blindly consuming animals whose death they do not have to consider — this is not the 'natural order' at all.	Equating "natural" and "not immoral" clearly could be used to justify any activity and status quo, and is a fallacy. Eating meat must be judged not simply on whether it is "natural", but whether it is necessary \(in todays advanced society\), and in the context \(e.g. what is best for humans? for society? for the animals?\)	It may not be immoral to eat other animals, but the fact that having to grow animals to satisfy this need creates environmental issues may make it immoral.	If domesticated animals are raised ethically in a way as to have reasonable lives, then they are allowed to exist and experience life, where in a world without meat farming they probably would not.	This isn't just an issue about morality or natural order. This is also an issue about resources, raising animals, fishing and a lot of other related activities consume lots of resources. Population is growing and with the population, the needs of humanity as a whole. The massive amounts of resources needed for meat mass consuption in todays format is an ineficient and irresponsable use of the resources of the planet, which will unavoidibly affect humanity itself as well as the whole planet.	Nature is much more cruel in the way of animal on animal violence. When humans kill most animals for food it is done in a fast and humane way.	Lots of animals are herbivores, and don't eat other animals. Eating animal is not more natural than eating plants.	If eating meat is morally wrong and we are obligated to minimize the meat humans eat, we are also morally obligated to minimize the meat other animals eat.

Every organism on earth dies or is killed at some point, so other organisms can live. This is how nature works.	con	Other animals eat animals too. For humans, as for these animals, it is therefore only natural.	Animals sometimes die out when a new predator interrupts a natural balance. Thus hunting animals to extinction is a natural process.	This argument implies the necessity of killing for survival. Humans do not depend on killing and eating animals for their survival, and certainly not through the mass-breeding of animals with the sole purpose of killing them.	There is no reason to assume that a natural lifestyle is essential \(healthwise or morally\), as there are plenty of reasons for humans to follow an "unnatural" lifestyle.	All living beings kill — either plant life or animal life — to survive. Even as a vegetarian, you're supporting the deaths of animals that lose habitat to farming, are killed for pest control, etc. The question isn't whether or not to kill--it's how to do so humanely.	It is natural for organisms to die so others can live. It is not natural for these organisms to be exploited, mass produced and fed growth hormones.	Nature is amoral. Humans are not.	If one day, humans disappear from earth, prey animals will be still eaten by other predators. Nature set up a system where some animals eat others. Humans are not a different creature, we only has a different weapon \(intelligence\) than other predators. Humans have no influence on nature's law; it is a system that was here long ago before humans even existed on this earth.	If we didn't eat animals, their equivalents in the wilds would still be eaten by other predators, so as long as we give our animals living conditions and deaths that aren't worse/less humane than ones in the wild, eating them makes no difference, morally speaking. Therefore, we should instead focus on improving the living conditions of animals and making their deaths as humane as possible. This is a far more realistic goal to focus on, compared to trying to prevent humanity from consuming meat.	This argument negates all contributions made by medicine.	Nature is quite specific about which animals routinely kill and eat others and which do not. A human without technology or fire would largely be unable to kill, butcher or eat anything other than perhaps a few bugs with their physical equipment. They lack sharp teeth and claws for ripping flesh and/or catching prey and a low enough stomach pH for safely digesting raw meat. Just like the other great apes, humans are physically adapted to consuming a predominantly plant based diet after weaning.

As a species, humans can naturally evolve, in time, from omnivore to herbivore. Many humans eat only plant-based foods without any health repercussions and so it is possible.

That we don't do so supports the idea we accept that this natural dynamic of predator-prey is not always overridden by animal welfare concerns.	con	Most people intuitively make a sharp distinction between the deaths of animals in the wild and the deaths of animals in farms, which suggests that they do not treat farms as simply another instance of the predator-prey dynamic.	That we ought to eliminate both the suffering of wild animals and the suffering of farm animals is a natural consequence of the idea that animals are morally important. It is not a conclusion that we should avoid.	It is [plausible to believe](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/) that most natural habitats are, on net, bad for animal wellbeing. If we cared overridingly about animal welfare, then we ought to destroy those habitats. The fact that we reject this indicates that animal welfare is not the overriding consideration, and that there is intrinsic value associated with the operation of natural habitats.	Humans are concerned about being responsible for the death of animals, so the question "Is eating meat wrong?" is about humans eating meat and being responsible for the caused harm, and not about non-human animals eating meat.	There is some concern for the [welfare of animals in the wild](http://www.animal-ethics.org/wild-animal-suffering-section/wild-animal-suffering-matters/), although the movement is probably not as large as it should be.	Humans have made improvements to nonhuman animals' habitats for welfare reasons. Examples of this are the [provision of water](https://www.thedodo.com/water-man-kenya-animals-2263728686.html) during droughts to prevent dehydration related suffering and deaths and the [construction of crossings](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/03/animal-wildlife-crossings/) over or under busy roads to prevent accident related injuries and deaths. The planting of biome-appropriate, food-producing plants to alleviate hunger might also be considered.	If the suffering of the eaten animal is what makes eating meat immoral, humans have as much right to meat or lack thereof than other meat-eating animals. Creating a world without animal consumption would make entire ecosystems dependent on the human existence and good will.	"Extreme forms of suffering like starvation, dehydration, or being eaten alive by a predator are much more common in wild animals than farm animals. Crocodiles and hyenas disembowel their prey before killing them \(Tomasik 2009\). In birds, diseases like avian salmonellosis produce excruciating symptoms in the final days of life, such as depression, shivering, loss of appetite, and just before death, blindness, incoordination, staggering, tremor and convulsions." \([Journal of Practical Ethics](http://www.jpe.ox.ac.uk/papers/consistent-vegetarianism-and-the-suffering-of-wild-animals/)\)	From a utilitarian perspective, to take farming away likely puts those animals in a state of nature or non-existence. Given nature's cruelty, there's little reason to believe either are better for the animal.	Many animals are killed and consumed by predators every day. The only difference is that humans do not perceive sadness when those animals suffer and are killed in the wild. It is actually the individual's perception that an animal is suffering \(when a human butchers it\) that causes him/her to feel pity, and not the fact that animals are suffering \(which happens all the time, everywhere\).

farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.	3_1.8.1.	Farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.	con	Millions of animals are [killed](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97836&page=1) every year to allow for appropriate land to grow crops such as wheat and barley.	A [study](http://freefromharm.org/common-justifications-for-eating-animals/comparing-animal-deaths-production-plant-animal-foods/) done on how many animals die to produce 1,000,000 calories of a number of different food sources found that for vegetables it is only 2.55 animals, while for beef it is 29 animals and for chicken it is 251.1. This suggests significantly fewer animals are harmed in the production of vegetarian products.	Converting land to make it suitable for harvesting soybeans and other vegetable products results in [habitat loss](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/impacts/habitat_loss/) that threatens entire ecosystems.	Since animals hurt by vegetarian farming are hurt as an unintended consequence, while producing meat necessarily involves killing animals, the former is moral and the latter is not.	The dairy and egg industries cause extreme animal maltreatment that is arguably on a par with the meat and fishing industries.	Killing pests - not just insects but large, intelligent animals - is a necessity on farms of any kind.	Land must be cleared both for farming crops and rearing livestock, so the cumulative damage done by vegetarian farming is still lower.	When we eat vegetables we are taking away food that animals could possibly eat. This could harm them in the long run.	Over time indirect animal deaths from farming could be reduced, if this was an explicit goal.	The argument is an example of [Whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) aka [Tu quoque logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque), and therefore does not directly refute the argument that eating meat is wrong.	Food production for humans will always directly or indirectly disturb the ecosystem of other animals. If we take that as a given then we have to ask ourselves what types of harm to animals and the broader ecosystem are acceptable tradeoffs when producing food.	Raising farm animals ultimately kills more plants than raising plant foods, due to the amount of feed required to raise the animals.	Insects are not what many people would consider "sentient animals", although they technically are. "Minimizing" the harm to a smaller volume of animals, or to animals from a specific phylum is sort of splitting hairs.	Most farmed animals live miserable lives on factory farms, which is arguably a more important consideration than the number of animals killed.

Small animals have far less sophisticated consciousness than most farm animals, so it is less morally wrong to kill them.	con	This logic leads then to the proposal that we eat more chicken and less beef, or that we eat more mice instead of chicken or beef. But there is no way to calculate the level of consciousness of a chicken compared to a cow and then multiply that by the number of chickens needed to replace the meat in one cow.	This is not certain. Elephants are far larger than humans, but also widely acknowledged to be less intelligent, even if more intelligent than "average" animals. Without first-hand insight into the thoughts and consciousness of any given animal, all we have is guesswork from observed behaviour.

When we eat vegetables we are taking away food that animals could possibly eat. This could harm them in the long run.	con	Through innovative new farming technology, such as hydroponic [vertical farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_farming), food for animals can be produced in a very effective and sustainable manner.	Nature itself has a way of regulating wild life population. In the long run the population of for example cows will decrease, ensuring enough food.	Our produce is overwhelmingly grown in farms, not harvested, and thus not taken out of nature and away from animals. If you meant that any fruit that's eaten by a human was stolen from animals because it could have theoretically been gifted to an animal, than you'd have to consider eating anything stealing from every other animal on Earth, including humans.	Generally feeding animals farm-grown produce is thought to have harmful affects on both the animal and human populations of a region when we could allow nature to self-regulate its populations. Animal feeding could potentially be used to lessen the immediate impact of widespread deforestation on some species, but generally this would be drastically less efficient than choosing not to destroy their habitats in the first place and would only slow the local animal population's imminent demise.

the limited sentience of most animal species means that they can be used to fulfill human desires, such as through farming, as long as it is not unnecessarily cruel.	3_1.8.4.6.	The limited sentience of most animal species means that they can be used to fulfill human desires, such as through farming, as long as it is not unnecessarily cruel.	con	All animals display the instinct to self-preservation, that is, the instinct to avoid pain or damage to their bodies.	We are not sure of this "limited sentience" and, in fact, the further into animal intelligence we dive, the more evidence we find that intelligence and self-awareness are far more widespread than we once thought. Some of the animals we consume as food are, in fact, quite intelligent - capable of problem solving, complex social relationships, even communicating in ways that border on language.

Animals cannot have rights, if their behavior does not acknowledge this assumed virtue, but rather could only be benefactors of human charity. Human charity would bestow, upon animals, privileges as opposed to rights.	Even if society did not exist and humans lived in a state of anarchy, it would still be immoral to murder or torture people. This indicates that rights exist independently of social construction.	This claim makes multiple statements. "Rights do not exist in the natural world" is true. However, "animals do not have rights at all" is false. They have rights when we grant rights to them.

"human rights" are not laws of the universe but rather a practical tool humans use to govern interaction with each other. they are a means of outlining and governing acceptable behavior so that we may live peacefully with each other. we can do this because we can communicate with each other and hold each other accountable. we cannot communicate with other species and hold them accountable in the same way yet.  a wolf does not understand, and will not respect, a universal right to life.	3_1.8.4.9.

In other words, the right to life — for anything, is not an intrinsic value. Therefore, outside the confines of a society which grants \(which allows\) the right to life, humans do not have a right to life.	Stating that one's capacity to understand, communicate with others, and hold others accountable for their actions is not sufficient reason to argue that non-human animals should not also have a right to life. Babies and the elderly who've lost their capacity for reason are two examples of humans who do not have the capacity to understand, communicate with others, and hold others accountable for their actions. Yet, our society grants them the right to life.	Rights can be enforced on both humans and nonhuman animals, such as by imprisoning a murderer \(or predator\) that would infringe on others' right to life and safety.	We only experience human consciousness, but we don't know for sure whether animals are conscious or not. We do have some evidence suggesting that animals do have social systems which govern acceptable behaviour, communicate with each other, and hold each other accountable. We cannot discount their perspectives and values simply because we aren't able to understand them.

It is cruel, but morality is a very relative concept. In the perspective of the animal kingdom, we are part of the omnivore group, and eating meat is what our species do, as many many others. Applying morality to nature is pointless, many other species cause harm to many others. Applying the term morality to meat eating is pointless and counterproductive to the actual goal: to reduce harm to some animals.	Moral arguments are often subjective. The comparative harm of eating say, an oyster, versus a higher plant which may, according to studies have a central nervious system depends on philosophical assumptions that are unprovable, such as that plants do not feel, or the degree to which animals feel.	Moral relativism is a weak standard of morality, with no true consideration of why things are wrong, it is only an example of [stage 4 of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development).

For example, humans could not subjectively determine that some races have fewer rights than others.	Animals have preferences, as frequently demonstrated through their actions, so under preference utilitarianism their demonstrated preferences should be taken into account.	Finding morality in consulting ones own or wider society's values is necessarily subjective. Consulting reason however leads to deontological ethical truths free from subjectivity.	Morality apply to things we chose to apply it to. For example, some humans chose to treat other humans less morally, such as criminals or simply a person they don't like based on their ideology, therefore, it is normal for humans to be "cruel and immoral" selectively, including to animals.	Morality only applies to humans. Morality functions to allow people to live together and cooperate in social groups. Morality is an irrelevant concept in the context of the natural world.

Morality is an irrelevant concept in the context of the natural world.	con	Humans are the only species on our planet with the power of sophisticated ethical reasoning. It is because of this that we can be bound by morality, which can include prescriptions about how we should or should not act on our environment and other beings in that environment.	Humans are part of the natural world. If morality is an irrelevant concept in the context of the natural world, it follows that morality must be irrelevant in the context of humans. But the author states that morality applies to humans. This is a contradiction, and therefore the claim taken as a whole is logically invalid.	We already apply moral concepts to non-human animals in most societies. Forms of animal cruelty are illegal in many countries, showing that we can intuitively and practically apply moral reasoning to non-human animals.	The philosophy of non-consumption of animals IS a human moral construct asserting itself onto human beings.  Vegetarianism isn't being applied to the animals. Animals are not being held to moral standards; we are.	Good morality and excercise of care is essential to keep both the human mind and the ecosystem in a healthy state, while ignorance will only lead to endless self inflicted suffering. Animals are not held under the same moral standards as human beings.	The problem with your argument is that many people don't actually contribute to society... Are we allowed then to experiment on them\(mentally handicapped, children...\)?	If being right means being beneficial to human species, then moral goodness is a merely “objective” property \(in principle measurable\) about the physical effects of something. But moral statements are not merely descriptive. People may disagree morally without disagreeing about any facts about the physical world and its laws.	If morality served only to allow people to live together and co-operate then all kinds of wrongs would be morally permissible. People can live together and co-operate in a society that allows slavery, forced child marriage, brutal excessive punishments or female genital mutilation, for example.	Morality is a subjective standard, and relative only to the standard which has been agreed is moral. "Right" and "wrong" cannot be debated objectively.

Ceasing to eat meat would mean that vast quantities of livestock would die without being replaced as they are unable to survive effectively outside of human agriculture.	con	Animals are meant to exist as part of a food chain. If we, the apex predators, simply stopped consuming meat thousands of species \(cows, sheep, pigs etc..\) would become extinct as they only exist due to their value as food, due to selective breeding. This would invariably destabilise countless ecosystems.	Even if there was a one-off slaughter of all of those livestock, it is still a preferable outcome from the perspective of animal welfare to prevent the enslavement of untold future generations of animals.	The quantity of animals that exist is less important than having each animal posses a good quality of life free of suffering.	Veganism is endangering animals. Diversity of all kinds is worth preserving. Without demand for animal products the majority of domesticated animal breeds would become extinct. Cows do not exist in the wild, they exist within the framework of supply and demand. Just because animal diversity was created by humans doesn't make it less valuable than natural diversity. Treat animals well within the supply and demand structure. Don't prevent them being born by removing the need for them.	Current farming practices prevent certain species from going extinct. Animals bred on farms have been selectively bred for centuries, resulting in genetically imprinted tendencies. Many widely farmed species are incapable of surviving in the wild. With many species being sustained solely to provide nutritional purpose, veganism would effectively disincentivise the further preservation of these species. Notably, cattle, chickens, and sheep come to mind.	The habitat, well being, and continued survival of a majority of domestic livestock is directly dependent upon human consumption of meat.	All farmed animals are artificially inseminated more times a year than it is natural. So left alone, farm animals will become half in number after the first generation dies.	All farm animals have natural predators, which means that, left in the wild, around a third of them will be eaten.	This claim implies that what effectively amounts to an unnatural overpopulation of farm animals is desirable.	It would be ethically permissible to allow these excess animals to live pleasant lives and die of old age without being replaced. The moral objective is not to maintain a certain quantity of farm animals, rather to maintain an acceptable quality of life for all animals wherever possible, and avoid actively wronging them.

Plants/trees live for 100s of years, they just don't feel the same amount of pain as animals do because of their slow growth. However, you're still hurting them. For example, think of us as trees and mosquitoes as humans.	Increased farming to produce more plant foods will result in an increase in the amount human exploitation in countries where work regulations and workers rights are poor. Perhaps these concerns should be addressed first?	We don't eat other humans. Why? Because we're so similar to them, so we feel strong empathy. Animals share much of the same DNA, biology and even emotions as humans, so we feel strong empathy for them as well. Plants, however, are from a separate biological kingdom, and work very differently from both humans and animals. Although we do have to eat some organic food to survive, we can choose the source that causes the least suffering from our human perspective.	Workers can suffer in both plant and animal agriculture, so this not an argument for or against either of them.	Eating botanical fruit from plants is not damaging to the plant in any way, so it is not cruel. Some vegetables are actually, in the botanical sense, fruit. Conversely, eating root vegetables, for example, is damaging to the plant. But since plants are not biologically designed to feel pain, it is not cruel to eat them.	Assuming this was true, consuming meat indirectly consumes vast amounts of plants that are used as animal feed. Eating meat means indirectly contributing to the death of both plants and animals, not animals instead of plants.	Cruelty suggests suffering. As plants lack any sensory system, and by observation take longer to die, it is perhaps safer to assume that less suffering means less pain. As plants do not experience physical pain, such a claim is moot.

For scientific claims such as these, journalistic sources are simply insufficient, and scientific literature should be cited.	Plants do not have a brain, so do not have a consciousness	The amount of consciousness that a plant could potentially have is nothing in comparison to the amount of consciousness had by animals	Further in the future, it could be possible to transition to wholly synthetic food or other means of fuelling our bodies.	The feeling of pain is produced by the nervous system. Plants do not have a nervous system so it is very unlikely that they could feel emotions at all.	Killing an animal without causing suffering is equal to killing a plant. Both have the right to live.	Plants never felt and never will feel pain. It is true, that they might have a basic awareness of their surrounding and can react to stimulis, but plants all in all lack a brain and a nervous system. Whereas animals clearly express their pain by screaming, running away etc. Plants can not react this way.This fact suggest that they are not experiencing pain. It would be straight up cruel, if nature would have ''given'' plants the ability to feel pain, since they cant move and avoid it.	The fact that plants *might* feel pain does not justify causing definite pain to animals.	It's not simply pain but also suffering. There's no good evidence that plants are conscious so they cannot suffer in any meaningful way, even if they can react to a stimulus which could be called 'pain'.	The focus should be on minimizing suffering. Humans cannot survive without eating and it seems apparent that if plants suffer, they suffer less and qualitatively differently.	Plants are the bottom of the food chain. Nothing higher up the food chain can survive without plants being eaten. Humans cannot survive without plants in their food chain.	Raising farm animals ultimately kills more plants than raising plant foods, due to the amount of feed required to raise the animals.	Science might not be yet aware of the full spectrum of flora "feeling". We might, however, one day discover \(and are in the process of\) that they suffer and feel just like humans and other beings.	The alternative to eating meat on ethical grounds is eating plant based material. Plants, though, are life forms too. There is no alternative in which one eats inorganic matter or avoids killing. It is arbitrary and reductive to state that human life matters, and less complex animal life matters, but still less complex plant life does not. Consuming other species is inherent to human existence; It is naive to congratulate oneself on only killing and consuming a certain variety of life.

While much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. Ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources \(i.e. free range farming\) that afford animals the same \(if not better\) quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.	con	In many, if not most, places it is much more difficult or [expensive](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-money-chicken-organic/is-organic-chicken-worth-the-price-idUSKBN0FM24Q20140717) for consumers to purchase truly 'ethical' meat rather than to simply opt for a vegetarian option.	Even under an 'ideal' farming circumstances \(i.e. free range; painless death\) killing an animal still violates its right to life. To do so for such as simple \(and substitutable\) need such as food is immoral.	It is impossible to upscale 'ethically sourced' meat production to meet the huge demand for meat, in order to not change current meat consumption habits. 'Better consumer choice' is therefore impossible on a global scale.	Every sentient animal has the same moral status. You therefore can't treat pigs and cows as means to an end if you can't treat humans as means to an end.	Eating meat is not cruel and immoral if the animals that are being consumed are provided with humane living conditions, able to live full lives, and die of natural causes.	Animals cannot possibly enjoy the same quality of life that they'd have had in the wild if they were bred and raised with the sole purpose of being eaten.	The "free range" designation is not well regulated in the United States, and is more of a marketing term than a true indicator of how animals are treated. There are no rules enforcing the quality, size or degree of access to the outside.	It is immoral to bring creatures into existence in order to use and kill them. For example, it would be immoral to give birth to new children and use them as slaves or food.	Unlike wild animals, farmed animals are born explicitly due to human action. While we may have a duty to ensure that their lives are not unnecessarily cruel, it is not immoral to kill them for our own ends given they would not have existed otherwise.	Free range animals are often worse for the environment, [as they are more resource intensive in terms of land and less efficient in terms of food conversion](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2149220-grass-fed-beef-is-bad-for-the-planet-and-causes-climate-change/). Meanwhile, lower welfare animals benefit from efficiency of scale \(heat recapture in intensive farms for example\). Meat eaters must choose between welfare and the environment. Vegans need not make such a choice.	We can eat meat responsibly - choose carefully, develop small productions and local food, and make it a rare and savoured special dish.	The best way to incentivise humane and quality meat production is to buy and eat more from local farms. Avoiding meat entirely causes industrial meat factories to cut costs even more, leading to even more unethical production. Vote with your money.	Do means justify ends? We cannot argue the humaneness of raising animals for consumption when the end goal is their slaughter en masse anyway.	What is actually wrong is the treatment of animals in the  "meat industry", not the meat-eating itself. So, a change in the meat "production" would solve the problem, in a way that makes ceasing to eat meat unnecessary.	While is possible that ethical farms exist, there are no ethical slaughter houses. They are all horrifying death factories that expose animals to unimaginable stress and have terrible effect on human workers.	Nothing in the world had to be cruel, it just is. Facing the situation where animals are being constantly tortured in the name of bigger profits and simply advocate for a moral shift is an over simplification. Defend an ethical way to produce meat is a nice thing but not practical	Choosing to eat meat ethically is a luxury that many can't afford. Ethically produced meat is generally expensive and cheaper meat is generally amongst the least ethically produced.	All animals are not the same in their ability to grow meat while suffering. Good animal welfare \(and meat quality\) is highly correlated with high meat production rates in beef for example. There is a profit incentive to increasing animal welfare outcomes in this case. Therefore if consumers chose to eat meats of this type there would be financial incentives for the big meat producers to maximise animal welfare.	Animals can be raised in ways that cause little-no suffering, such as organically where they are free to roam outside and not fed things like growth hormones.	Despite attempts to advocate for better farming, farms are becoming more industrialised over time. See for example the graph [Annual Pig Crop Distribution by Size of Operation – United States: 1994-2014](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/rr171x21v/cz30pw658/js956j577/hogview-10-29-2015.pdf). There is no evidence that consumers can realistically reverse this trend.
in those cases, consumers could have a moral obligation to either purchase the expensive ethical meat or not purchase meat at all. this still would not imply that we should never eat meat.	3_1.8.14.1.1.

Most animals lack essential prerequisites for the right to life, like self-awareness or the ability to have desires about the future. While they may have a right to be free of suffering, they do not have a right to life.	con	Claiming truth with no definition of the "right to life" or where this is a prerequisite to have desires about the future is not an argument. You have simply claimed these things as self evident truths. Also claimed animals are not self aware.  Which animals? Who said? When? etc.	Animals demonstrate their desires for the future through their actions. For example, they try to flee from danger and become panicked in slaughterhouses, so they clearly have specific desires about the future to not be killed.	One should err on giving more rights than less. Even if the essential prerequisites for rights are vague, we should err on respecting life rather than disrespecting it.	The main animal farming victims are examples of complex lifeforms that do not constitute borderline cases and should be given the right to life.

we should measure the morality of our actions towards animals on whether we fulfil their desires while they are alive, not on an abstract logical deduction regarding the nature of sentience. pigs, for example, want to wallow in the mud, eat, reproduce, and have a painless death; we can fulfil all those desires and also eat the pigs afterwards, thus we can, morally, treat them as a means to an end.	3_1.8.14.4.2.

What is cruel is the factory farm system we use to get the meat. If we can get the meat without causing undue pain to the animal, there is no issue.	Animals are currently being treated horribly, but many meat eaters are using their sway as actual consumers to improve animals' living conditions. This combined attention and sway is sure to help animal rights in the long run.	Cruelty, being a trait derived from the human mind, is only applicable to meat consumption if it is done irresponsibly as compared to other consumers of meat in the animal kingdom.	Humans can make a choice to reduce the cruelty and immoral treatment of animals, as well as to reduce their consumption to a naturally sustainable amount.  This would be more likely to work if there weren't corporate "factories" for meat production--if humans were required to raise and/or hunt their own prey, and if there were distinct regulations disallowing and punishing animal cruelty on any spectrum.	Eating meat and cruel/immoral treatment of animals are not mutually exclusive - one can exist without the other. Large farms or "reserves" where animals are able to live a full and healthy life is a possible example. Likewise, it could also be assumed that ending the suffering for animals who are injured or already dying is more humane and less wasteful than allowing their suffering or wasting their remains.	Even free range farming violates the rights of animals by imprisoning them \(albeit in a larger enclosure\) and eventually killing them against their will.	Farm animals by definition cannot enjoy humane living conditions, since their freedom of movement will necessarily have to be violated.

not eating the meat of animals killed for other purposes would be a waste and thus morally wrong.	3_1.8.24.	Not eating the meat of animals killed for other purposes would be a waste and thus morally wrong.	con	There are very few opportunities to eat animals killed by non-human causes. Eating only those animals would be very similar to not eating any meat at all.	Many religions use animal sacrifices. It would be a waste to not then eat those animals.	Selling meat from animals that have been killed anyway creates a demand for meat, which then encourages people to kill more animals than otherwise would have died.	Since a lot of institutions and professionals sustain that a diet that contains meat will necessarily cause a lot of health problems for the eater, not eating meat is not a waste. If someone doesn't want to drink poison, we would not say that they are 'wasting' poison.	Most of us wouldn't like the idea of eating a pet, regardless of its cause of death. Moral wrongness can vary depending on a person's view of how a dead body ought to be treated, and this subjective moral view varies wildly throughout culture, and from person to person.	We don't consider the food we feed to our pets "wasted". Every organism eventually "feeds" the ecosystem in which it dies \(including humans\), thus it's invalid to call organic matter objectively "wasted" simply because humans aren't the ones eating it.	Many societies, admittedly, less that are around today, [cannibalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannibalism) their dead for religious purposes, out of reverence for them.	Many animals that we eat or commodify were brought into existence by humans and would otherwise not exist. By reducing the demand for meat, we reduce the animals that are killed for any reason. Therefore, it is only a waste because we have created something we do not need.	Humans have morally acceptable reasons to kill animals besides eating them. If a human has a good reason to kill an animal it would be immoral to waste the edible sections of that animal.	In practice, yes, but to be precise, eating the flesh from dead bodies is not cruel nor immoral if the act can be shown to never create demand for the murdering of animals. A free-range animal that dies from natural causes could have its body eaten without causing any suffering. Anonymously eating murder meat purely from others' leftovers also causes no suffering. Necessarily cruel and immoral are the various acts of torture and finally the murder, not the flesh-eating part which has exceptions.	If animals get fatally hurt it is better to eat them than to waste the meat.

consuming meat is an important part of many cultures and religions.	3_1.9.	Consuming meat is an important part of many cultures and religions.	con	Some of the oldest forms of human expression and art are [cave paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting) of wild game, prey of humans. The chase and consumption of meat have therefore constituted a central component of human culture since its beginning.	Cultural components change over time: cultural transformation is a natural dynamic process.	In many cultures, a meatless diet plays an important cultural role.	Living on a meatless diet is not viable or stigmatized in some countries and regions.	Eating habits change, and meat has not always been an integral part of most cultures. Only [relatively recently](http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/GDPE/Distinguished_Ecologists/2006/Smil/Eating%20Meat.pdf) has the consumption of meat become wide-spread, for example during the mid-19th century in Europe and not until the mid-20th century in large parts of China.	Many religions explicitly permit or encourage eating animals.	People from rural areas will be ostracized if meat consumption falls because it is far more easy to raise animals than to plow the land.	A deliberate cultural evolution away from meat will overcome many current cultural issues with not eating meat.	Once a culture has the resources and technological knowhow to live in a way that avoids harms it previously needed for survival, that culture permanently progresses. Other cultures may have a valid argument for consuming meat or other [ESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy) such as raids involving murder of rival tribes' members. Western culture, with its great abundance and alternate foods, does not.	In the most world-renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.	Culture explains behavior but does not necessarily justify it.

Non-meat eaters oftentimes require special effort from the hosts of social gatherings.

The general trend shows [meatless](http://www.mfablog.org/veganism-taking-the-world-by-storm) diet is on the rise all over the world.	As a meatless diet does not restrict people in any common social situations it cannot be insociable.	In many countries, restaurants often serve not a variety of dishes, but variants of a single dish. If this dish is not meatless, it either excludes vegetarians, or requires groups with 1 or more vegetarians among them to actively avoid these restaurants when eating out, restricting choice on social venues for all involved.	In many countries - for example [China, Japan and Korea](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=uMnubkF5HjAC&pg=PA3&dq=vegetarianism+concept+korea&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=vegetarianism%20concept%20korea&f=false) - the very concept of a meatless diet is not widely popular and recognized, hence maintaining a meatless diet can come with obstacles.	There are many meat eaters which have certain food preferences and will not ever eat certain dishes. However noone would say they are insociable because of that.	People with certain food allergies / intolerances \([Coeliac disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease), [lactose intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance), histamine intolerance, nut allergies etc.\) will not ever eat certain dishes, but noone would say they are insociable because of that.

For example, the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic, the Chukotka of the Russian Arctic, the Masai, Samburu, and Rendille of East Africa.	The solution to this would be to minimize stigmatization and increase availability of meatless diets, not embrace eating meat.

as there are no absolute standards for judging right and wrong, good and bad, as these terms are products of social agreement, individuals can only use their culture and the values / attitudes it has created for moral guidance. from this point of view, the dominant culture thus explains and justifies behavior.	3_1.9.11.13.	As there are no absolute standards for judging right and wrong, good and bad, as these terms are products of social agreement, individuals can only use their culture and the values / attitudes it has created for moral guidance. From this point of view, the dominant culture thus explains and justifies behavior.	con	Moral relativism is self-defeating in this case. Suppose all cultures should follow their own ethical codes. It then follows that if our culture's code says that eating meat is unethical, then we should condemn everyone who eats meat, no matter what culture they are from.	Some cultural practices are obviously wrong. For example, slavery and torture are wrong, even if most people once thought they were right. So there are some universal moral standards that exist independently of cultural opinion.	Moral relativism is a weak standard of morality, with no true consideration of why things are wrong, it is only an example of [stage 4 of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development). We need a better reason, a real reason why things are right, or wrong, like [overall happiness,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) [rights,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract)or [good will.](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/the-good-will/)	The fundamental moral truth, that pain and suffering in living beings should be minimized as much as possible, has to be the foundation of any discussion and has to supersede cultural values. Otherwise things like slavery and ritual killings would need to be considered morally OK, just because they are part of a certain culture. This would make argument-/logic-based discussions about what is morally right/wrong pointless. Thus, if such a discussion shall take place, culture can't be an argument.	According to meta-ethical [moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism) in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong.	According to [moral universalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_universalism), a system of ethics applies universally, that is, for all individuals, regardless of culture.	All humans are a part of a certain culture and society, which fundamentally characterizes their values and attitudes. Thus behavior of a certain culture can only be judged in comparison.

Though there may be some health benefits associated with eating meat, [many](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/10/meat-wars/599728/) humans typically eat much more of it than is healthy or necessary to obtain such benefits.	The human body does not require consumption of animal protein.	One of the foods with the [highest](https://www.healthaliciousness.com/articles/foods-highest-in-protein.php) protein to calorie ratio is cheese, which is not a meat product.	Meat is packed with protein. While there are other ways to get protein, lean meats are an extremely healthy and efficient way to obtain it.	Vegetarians/vegans generally consume a diet consisting of [less](http://www.livestrong.com/article/481795-the-statistics-of-vegetarians-vs-meat-eaters/) saturated fat and cholesterol than the average meat eater.	A meatless diet helps build healthy bones because vegetarians absorb more calcium than meat eaters.	[Good fats](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good) come mainly from vegetables, nuts, seeds; not from meat.	Without a carefully balanced diet non-meat eaters could suffer from certain deficiencies, like [protein](http://vegetarian.lovetoknow.com/Protein_Deficiency_Symptoms#Fur0di7vVrR60mUF.97) or [vitamin B12](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/guide/vitamin-b12-deficiency-symptoms-causes#1).	Maintaining a meatless diet in a meat-eating society is costly and requires nutrient planning.	Rapid evolution of humans was directly supported by the high protein diet of eating meat.  Meat diets provide more energy and nutrients that are more filling and energy efficient than plant based diets. Thus, precious time and energy is saved with the more efficient meat diet. Time and energy that can be used for different things like evolution, education, and technological advancements.	Vegetables do not sufficiently contain the nutrition needed by the human species, and additionally the much larger space requirements because of lower caloric density mean that relying on vegetation alone is not likely to be feasible, especially in comparison with the feasibility of creating ethically sound animal husbandry conditions and even changing to use less-neurologically-complex organisms as food sources, such as shrimp and aquaponics.	There is no one-size-fits-all regiment for optimal health and nutrition for human beings. It may very well be that some of us are more genetically wired to thrive on vegetable only diets while others need to metabolize meat.	Neal Barnard of the [Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine](http://www.pcrm.org/media/experts/neal-barnard) notes that when people switch from meat-eating to plant-eating, their intake of vitamins and other nutrients improves.	Plant protein products are improving. You can receive the same levels of proteins and vitamins without the chemicals and hormones found in meat products.

A [recent study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/11/07/1707322114) shows that vegan diets would not provide sufficient nutrition for the current population without supplementation potentially causing disease.	Meat is essential for a healthy diet, especially for developing and maintaining muscles.	The bioavailability of vegetable matter is much lower than meat for human beings. Not only is meat cellular tissue far more similar in constitution to our own cells than plant cells, but it is far easier, for example, to extract the majority of iron available in red meat than it is for us to extract iron present in vegetation such as spinach, only a small fraction of which is available.	Meat is the best source of [vitamin B12](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/1/131.long), a vitamin necessary for the nervous system and digestive system health.	It may be arguable that essential nutrients in meat are generally more bioavailable from those sources. For example, omega-3, choline. It is also arguable that mineral balances such as copper-zinc that are recommended for health are identical to that which one would receive from a meat heavier diet, rather than plants. Likewise saturated fats serve essential roles in the composition of hormones, in the brain, heart and liver. In other words, in the long run, a vegan diet may be harmful.

There is [some evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137939/) that ceasing to eat meat would harm brains of those who are in the developmental age.	A Stone Age diet is the most natural and beneficial diet to the human gut. Meat and fats and some grains and fruit. Studies have shown that those people who follow this ancient way of eating are less susceptible to diabetes, heart disease and cancers. Take a look at this article which shows how fat is very important to the human diet.[files.meetup.com](http://files.meetup.com/1463924/Homo%20Carnivorous-WAPF2.pdf)	Some of the most healthful nutrients come exclusively or in greater bioavailability from animals sources: liver containing CoQ10, B vitamins, zinc, iron, chromium and other trace minerals, bone broth containing collagen supporting compounds such as hyluronic acid and glucosamine. While vegetarian diets can be healthful, they lack many nutrients that, while present in vegetables, have much less bioavailability. Humans thrive only when consuming moderate amounts of healthy animal food sources.	Animals process a vegetarian diet. Meat is the effect of that process - and this is why meat packs more nutrients in than vegetables. The organs and bones of the animal are particularly high in essential nutrients.	Eating just the cooked muscle is unhealthy. When meat is cured it increases it's bio availability and introduces good bacteria which facilitates digestion; coupled with eating bone broth and organs, eating meat in this way is extremely healthy.

the science of diet is far from settled. this is a complex topic that will take many decades, if not centuries to understand. the advent of quantum super computer arrays will undoubtedly speed our understanding of diet, but today, there is much to learn about nutrition and heath. to suggest otherwise is to be dishonest about the topic. take the science of salt consumption as a recent example. today, it is now known that the dangers of too little salt vastly out weigh the dangers of too much.	3_1.10.13.5.

humans are accustomed to eating meals containing meat. the meals not only gives us proteins that are important for several bodily functions but also even the people who are eating vegetables don't necessarily become healthier. you become healthier based on you intake of foods that your body needs, which may include meat. i think that genes, outside factors \(smoking, levels of stress, sleep time, junk food etc.\), have a actually bigger toll on the body than the actual consumption of meat.	3_1.10.13.8.

None of the nutrients listed are exclusive to meat. The rest of your argument is based on conjecture.

the eating of meat increased in the verge of wwii and the farming of animals was exacerbated; however this was due to  consumer demand. it's very difficult to build political measures for consumption reduction unless it's a global measure. the greater power is the market, the second is the consumer.	3_1.10.14.1.

Without supply there would be no demand, and the change would naturally be gradual, letting the animal product market gently fade, transition, and evolve to meet the new needs of this earth.
avoidance of all meat is a luxury good, only realistic in a healthy manner, in rich societies. in poor societies practicing vegetarianism, it often correlates with malnutrition. in most societies, this claim is both arrogant and moralizing, condemning poor countries to malnutrition, contributing to expanding in equality.	3_1.10.15.

We, the golden billion, can afford to choose. The rest of the world can not. So only after complete worldwide victory over the global problem of hunger we can afford to debate about what type of food should we choose to eat. But even then the humanity would just not have any possibilities to produce enough vegetarian food for all of our fast-growing population. It may be good, but it's simply impossible on this step of human evolution.

assuming that vegans are healthier and do live longer, these extra years of life mean that they continue to damage the environment. this makes it less ethical, not more, to remove meat from people's diets.	3_1.10.18.	Assuming that vegans are healthier and do live longer, these extra years of life mean that they continue to damage the environment. This makes it less ethical, not more, to remove meat from people's diets.	con	Assuming life long veganism and assuming it is less damaging to environment, comparisons need to be made between lifetime damage to environment on vegans vs omnivores, considering vegans would potentially have longer lives but less damaging time on earth.	According to [this study](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/78/3/526S/4689992), life expectancy might be slightly greater \(3.6 yrs\) for long term vegetarians - around a 4.5% increase, assuming an average lifespan. This is probably not great enough to negate the environmental benefits; [this study](https://www.nature.com/articles/1602522) suggests at least 13% reduction of impact for vegetarians, or 28% for vegans.
