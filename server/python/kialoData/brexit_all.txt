Leaving the EU allows the UK to see the effects of leaving.	The UK will always be seen as the country that decided to leave the party. This would impact its international image and relationships.	Brexit has inspired far-right movements in Europe.	In the long term, it will provide economic value to the UK.	The UK will have more freedom and sovereignty to make decisions that will make a difference, without vetting of the EU.	It will allow the UK to improve the NHS.	Many people did not realise the complexity of such a decision.	The UK has faced political and parliamentary divisions as a result of Brexit.
