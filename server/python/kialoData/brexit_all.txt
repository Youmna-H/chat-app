Leaving the EU allows the UK to see the effects of leaving.	The UK will always be seen as the country that decided to leave the party. This would impact its international image and relationships.	Brexit has inspired far-right movements in Europe.	In the long term, it will provide economic value to the UK.	The UK will have more freedom and sovereignty to make decisions that will make a difference, without vetting of the EU.	It will allow the UK to improve the NHS.	Many people did not realise the complexity of such a decision.	The UK has faced political and parliamentary divisions as a result of Brexit.

Being in the EU helps the UK negotiate on the world stage with the weight of [512M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union) people and the cost of negotiation spread across 27 countries.

The UK has always had a privileged position within the EU, with [special rules](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_renegotiation_of_European_Union_membership,_2015–16) that do not apply to other member states.

The United Kingdom needs alliances in order to realize its advantages \(financial center, research & technological know-how\); the natural partners are its historical colonies - the Commonwealth & the US. Stability with the “Continent,” however, which would leverage the UK’s advantages, was easier within the EU than outside it, in the medium to long term.

The decision to leave the party will be insignificant in comparison to the conduct of the nation's representatives throughout the withdrawal negotiations.
