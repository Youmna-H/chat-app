covid-19 vaccines should be mandatory.	0_1.	COVID-19 vaccines should be mandatory.	pro	It is enough if all the people who believe in vaccination are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. There is no need to make vaccination mandatory for those who don't believe in it.	Mandatory vaccines would be a huge overreach of state powers.	Mandatory vaccine policies have proved extremely helpful in the fight against other preventable illnesses.

Providing vaccinations to an entire population requires huge amounts of resources which can otherwise be used towards addressing more urgent public health issues.	The quickest and safest way to develop [herd immunity](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/work/protection) is through a mandatory vaccination policy.	Despite a wide variety of attempted measures, COVID-19 has continued to spread at a dangerous rate - vaccines are the best remaining option to protect and improve our lives.

Due to growing [anti-vaccination sentiment](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/21/rightwing-populists-ride-wave-of-mistrust-of-vaccine-science), it is unlikely that the government will be able to enforce mandatory vaccinations.

Vaccinations should be mandatory.	pro	Making vaccines mandatory will prevent any epidemics from occurring due to lack of adherence to vaccination programmes or public opinion shifting \(e.g. Anti-Vax movement\).	Vaccination program saves money because preventing the desease is less expensive than curing it \[[WHO](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/9/16-178475.pdf)\]. Thus, it reduces social assistance expenses.	Vaccines have \(potentially life-threatening\) side effects.	Medical institutions and regulatory bodies should not be trusted with a mandatory vaccination policy.	Parents choosing not to vaccinate their children is child neglect, and the government should intervene to prevent this.	Vaccination programmes rely on [herd-immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) to be effective.	Substantial population growth caused by vaccines may have a negative impact on the environment.	Mandatory vaccines would infringe upon individuals' human rights.	Vaccines should only be mandatory if they are also free, otherwise this places an unjust burden on low-income families which essentially punishes parents for being poor.	Enforcing vaccination will antagonize parents against governments and pharmaceutical companies and will lead to a more reduced amount of vaccinated children.	Evidence suggests vaccines are an effective means of protecting people from disease.
