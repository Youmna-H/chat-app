Veganism promotes empathy.	Vegan industries are often more transparent and supportive of workers' rights than their non-vegan counterparts.	Veganism is not as ethical as other lifestyles.	At present, human demand for meat outweighs our ethical concerns surrounding the eating of meat.

Killing animals for food is a [survival instinct](http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43484), and so not inherently unethical or morally blameworthy.	Unlike many examples of immoral behaviour such as homicide, whether eating meat constitutes an immoral act is not widely agreed-upon. In such cases where a consensus opinion is lacking, it seems questionable that arbitrary moral standards should be applied.	Because a vegan world would have less violence and cruelty than our world today where animals are killed and eaten, the [knock-on effects](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/knock-on%20effect) are something inconceivable to us currently. The possibilities for future moral benefits are virtually endless.	A [vegan approach](http://www.vegansociety.com) to the world tends to support the rights of humans, as well as benefiting animals.	The morals would not be justified if it comes at a cost or conflict with other important or grander values or people \(lives, societies, etc.\).	Some aspects of veganism involve racism. Racism could potentially get worse, through veganism, if implemented fully.

Thus, it can be redefined \(just like the word 'organic'\) by others to solidify the concept.

A vegan society would cause the least harm to wildlife.	pro	Since people eat more varieties of plants on a vegan diet than an omnivorous one, people can learn about, appreciate, and have a desire to protect biodiversity more.	In a vegan world, species would not be as endangered anymore, some species would not go extinct.	Consuming plants, in fact, can sometimes lead to man-animal conflict.	[Monocrop](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/environmental/monoculture-gardening.htm) agriculture to service vegan demand is an environmental catastrophe.	The [fishing industry is especially deleterious to the ocean's biota](http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6400/readings/Dayton_et_al._1995.pdf).	In addition to being not harmful, vegan foods can be very symbiotic with and beneficial to wildlife.	Infrastructure could be made more vegan. Efforts made by the [Boring Company](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/) to make car traffic go underground could reduce injuries to wildlife on Earth's surface.	Hunting for population control is better for the ecosystem and creates more protections for such species and populations than the vegan approach of not harming animals.	Pets \(like [cats](http://www.thegardenisland.com/2018/03/18/hawaii-news/feral-cats-make-invasive-species-list/) and [fish](http://www.saltwatersmarts.com/why-never-release-marine-aquarium-livestock-into-wild-2792/)\) can cause damage to the environment \(especially wildlife\) by becoming invasive. Not having them would decrease this issue.	A vegan society may not last in the long-term. Between when they start and end, they may remove all animal agriculture. So if the majority of people decide to not be vegan again, without livestock available, people may resort to eating wildlife, when they normally do not.	The risk of [death of wildlife](https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/viewhtml.php?id=281) increases during the transport of food, especially when the vegan food travels for thousands of miles by land. Local meat would cause less harm to wildlife during its transport.	If people eat [lake-grown algae](http://www.klamathafa.com/afa.html) for example, they are eating more lives in one bite than how many are lost to make a steak.

People can eat whatever they want as long as it does no harm	The idea of framing veganism as a natural right is to characterise service providers failing to offer vegan options as violating rights, not merely a right to procure vegan food without any impositions on others. Positive rights such as that do not exist.	Veganism is not necessary for survival and humans did not evolve to be vegan naturally. This makes veganism a choice unnecessary for survival. Therefore Veganism is an artificial ideology, not a natural right.	[Conscious creatures](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201801/animal-consciousness-new-report-puts-all-doubts-sleep) have Natural Rights corresponding to their potential to need them. Among the greatest of those rights is the right to not be abused or deprived of life. A human is therefore naturally entitled \(and morally obligated\) to make choices to respect animals' natural rights while procuring provisions to sustain their own life \(eg: food, shelter, warmth\).	The vegan lifestyle is sufficient to sustain human life. When compared to a non-vegan lifestyle, a vegan lifestyle does less harm to other species and results in a lesser sum of harms against other species. Therefore, veganism is a more basic level of lifestyle for survival than non-veganism, and non-vegans are essentially choosing to augment that basic lifestyle with non-vegan furnishings.	Humans sit in the greatest position of control on earth, to rule it and shape it as though the highest power in it. Since we are considering that inalienable rights are endowed by natural law, we must be inferring that there is a natural preference for how justice is shaped. Nature, \(particularly the expression of life\), is most at [peace](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/peace) when ruled in [fairness](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fair), so it follows that natural law should direct humans to be [benevolent](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/benevolent). Humans are meant to be vegan.	If someone is vegan for health reasons \(like being allergic to animal products\), then it's an inalienable right for them to be vegan.

If that actually were the case, people wouldn't be eating meat.	If it were the case that non-meat products were universally as good as meat, then vegetarians would not try, and also not to such a degree fail, to replicate the taste of meat.	Meat imitation products are expensive and are not a viable option for low-income individuals and families.	Faux meats are getting better over time as more people demand it. With more demand fake meats will taste better.	The very knowledge that one is eating an animal is pleasurable to many people and cannot be imitated with non-animal products. Certain meats carry status in many cultures, such as beef in the US.	[Artificial meat](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/artificial-chicken-grown-cells-gets-taste-test-who-will-regulate-it), which imitates the taste of real meat but is lab-grown, is being developed and could replace the taste experiences of real meat without the harm caused to animals, and with significantly less environmental consequences.	Vegetarian food offers more choices when meat is taken off the food plate. Usually there are small number of meat choices \(mostly chicken or beef with the occasional turkey, fish, and seafood\). The substitutions for this are numerous, from extra sides to faux meats.	In fact, meat itself has little to no taste, it's the texture it has and spices and flavors we add to it that makes it delicious. Other textured proteins like soy can have the same delicious taste and be almost unrecognizable.	Taste is an acquired habit. Some cultures that eat dogs, snakes, rabbits, snails etc. also do it because they acquired those tastes even though in other cultures eating one or more of those animals is considered disgusting. Same is with vegan food. There are several cultures that promote vegetarianism and of late veganism has also grown significantly. Also, all spices and flavorful ingredients added to food to enrich taste, like pepper, chilies, garlic, ginger, basil etc are all in fact, plants.	Eating is pleasurable in general. Finding more pleasure in one food type than in another is subjective and largely determined by personal experience with recepies and cooking, family traditions, memories, habits of one's environment, etc.	Stopping eating meat just means dropping a few ingredients. There are lots and lots of ingredients left to use and be creative with.

Popularity and pleasure has no relevance to what is right or wrong.	pro	Most people live in this common situation : where the satisfaction of most of our basic needs is already distorted, where sleep is sacrificed to save time, where amusement is seen as a waste of productivity, where having hobbies gives a sense of guilt about not using the time and money for more "important" things, where human relations are an open war for understanding, stability and social recognition \(...\) In such society, eating is the last basic need we can still take pleasure satisfying.	Concepts of right and wrong are formed by societies, and thus decided by popularity.	As people decide what choices are "right" or "wrong" based on how the choices serve the end goals they happen to value--be those goals the raising the quality of life of the world as a whole, just that of humans, or making more money as an individual--and those goals may not be shared by all of one's population, right and wrong are in fact concepts isolated from popular opinion.	Some ethical systems are built upon the concept of pleasure as the highest good, \(hedonic morality\), so pleasure does indeed factor into judgments of right and wrong for the many subscribing to such notions, i.e., meat eaters who hold their preferences in higher regard than the suffering of others.	If popularity or pleasure had any relevance, we would never abolish slavery and could use that to justify any form of exploitation.	It is not morally justifiable to value one's own taste over an animal's life.	Both popularity and pleasure are relevant to "right and wrong", or the concerns of ethics and morality. They certainly do not equate to morality on a one to one basis, not are they interchangeable with ethics or morality, but they are entirely relevant. Nearly every attempt at a cohesive system of ethics must take into account what is pleasurable to the individual and the larger society as well as the beliefs held by the majority of the population.	As the vegetarian diet can satisfy our nutritional needs, eating meat only to satisfy our taste buds is incompatible with a moral or ethical being.	"no relevance" is too strong. Taking away a preference for no good reason is wrong. "little relevance" would be more precise, as other common ethical concerned associated with eating meat trump personal pleasures.

It is not the decision of one person what another puts into their bodies.	This argument is based off an internally judged moral system. None of the claims have hard fact behind them. Confidence brings verisimilitude but has no effect on actual truth. Proper justification is based on reality not personal preference.	Such an act is justifiable from a hedonistic standpoint.	Plants are living as well and yet nobody seems to have a problem with harvesting them for consumption.	This has less to do with right and wrong, and more to do with justice. Is it just for humans to consume the flesh of other species when it is on longer necessary? There have been times in our history when it was necessary, but this is no longer the case, so a more relevant question would be 'should it be considered torture and murder to kill sentient beings when it is not a necessity?' If not, why? Why is it ok to kill animals who think and feel, when it is not necessary?	It is natural to eat whatever is convenient, even if it is not strictly necessary for survival. Bears, for example, are omnivores yet eat meat whenever [the opportunity arises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear#Behaviour).

There is no inherent difference between animals and humans; to insist otherwise is [speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism), the act of discriminating against a being on the basis of their species.	Humans are superior to all other animals, because they have the ability to make choices based on morality, and not instinct. It's what separates us from all other life known life forms.	Following that logic, animals are not superior to any other life form, they are simply a small part of a whole ecosystem. As such they have no legitimate right to kill other life forms as they please. This is inherently problematic.	The concept of "rights" is a creation of rational beings living in a society. The idea of "rights" seeks to transcend ecosystems and the "state of nature". If we are considering humans and other animals in their natural context of a state of nature in an ecosystem, then introducing rights is an inappropriate and anachronistic interjection.	When we look at it biologically, assigning less value to animals is a form of discrimination. It's just discrimination based on more features than within-species discrimination \(e.g. different anatomical structures or less intelligence instead of just the color of the skin\).

The normalizing of killing animals for food leads to a close-minded population less able to feel empathy and emotions for other species.	The uniqueness of humanity lies in its ability to reason beyond the forces of entropy and past the constraints of an impulse for survival. Humanity has for the most part conquered survival, and we continue to conquer the vices with which we were born as we progress towards something of a species to be proud of. We must undo these obsolete desires for pleasure as they come at the cost of life. It is in our power, our moral beliefs, and our logical perspective of life as humans to do so.	Our sapience necessitates moral standard.  A similar argument can be made against homosexuality. The naturalness or temptation of an act does not immediately award permission.	The wholesale slaughter of sentient non-human animals demonstrates that violence is an acceptable human behaviour.	Morality is wholly subjective, this argument presupposes an absolute moral authority counter to popular opinion. Indeed even if we were to follow the prevailing democratic subjective morality, the vast majority regularly eat meat. The idea that killing animals for food or eating meat is 'immoral' one can assume is an opinion held by [less than 10% of the global population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country) with not a single major territory where it is the prevailing norm.	The assumption that animals are not morally conscious is just that— an assumption. Prove it.	The more we learn about other animals, especially mammals, the more we learn they're intelligent, feeling beings. It is therefore morally and ethically wrong to continue farming and killing animals, and eating their meat, due to the suffering we cause them \(parent-child separation, cramped conditions, etc\).	We instinctively feel compassion towards animals, while carnivorous animals instinctively try to kill weaker species. E.g. Put a toddler and a rabbit in a crib, \(s\)he will hug it; put a lion cub and a rabbit in a crib, it will try to eat it.	Empathise with animals - how would you feel if your children were taken from you, fattened and then slaughtered for the purposes of feeding another beast. Or if you were herded into an abattoir where the friends you graze with are stunned and killed before you as you wait your turn. Cattle and pigs are mammals like us and experience the world through emotions not dissimilar to our own.	Abstaining from animal meat consumption allows one to reflect on more compassionate views of the world, and human involvement as caretakers of the ecology.	Morality is not absolute. While vegetarianism is a sign of moral virtue for [some Buddhists](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=RNBgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=buddhism+moral+vegetarianism&source=bl&ots=sdH97MDzta&sig=LZsKluIQOJ5QPhboqstbQTlePRA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp_7aBzoPNAhXmYaYKHQtDAQcQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=buddhism%20moral%20vegetarianism&f=false), eating meat has equally been interpreted as a [moral duty](http://animalethics.blogspot.kr/2011/06/roger-scruton-on-duty-to-eat-meat.html).

eating and producing meat heavily contributes to climate change.	3_1.1.4.8.1.1.9.2.1.1.7.1.6.1.	Eating and producing meat heavily contributes to climate change.	pro	The [meat](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet) lover's diet has the worst carbon footprint: about double the amount of a vegan diet.	[Livestock](http://www.worldwatch.org/global-meat-production-and-consumption-continue-rise-1) account for an estimated 18% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, producing 40% of the world’s methane and 65% of the world’s nitrous oxide.	Any major industry heavily contributes to climate change. This is not particular to meat production.	This does not make eating meat inherently wrong, because the massive scale of our population is the main cause of the massive scale of farming and therefore also the massive scale of green house gas emissions.	Farming meat has a disproportionate impact on the climate, contributing as many or more greenhouse gases than well-known polluters like cars and other industries.	Producing meat heavily contributes to climate change. Eating meat does not contribute to climate change. Even if it is true that humans should stop producing meat, it does not follow that humans should stop eating meat \(eg. from a hunted wild animal\).	It is critical to address climate change in order to prevent drastic effects \(up to and including mass extinctions\) on both humans and all other forms of life.	While meat production does entail production of [up to 9%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) of the world's greenhouse gases, the source of the carbon is less problematic than the other 91% of the carbon, mostly produced by fossil fuels. Cows belch methane, but this carbon originates from the atmosphere and goes back into the atmosphere in climate-boosted form. Fossil fuels take carbon formerly sequestered deep underground, and adds it to the atmosphere. So meat is problematic, but not in the same league as fossil fuel.	22% of meat [ends up in landfills in U.S, Canada, Australia, & New Zealand, collectively](https://www.savethefood.com). Meat in landfills [releases methane, which is 35x as potent in Global Warming Potential as carbon dioxide](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials) over the span of a century.	Meat's transport and storage requirements consume more resources and generate more emissions than for vegetables.	Focusing on the gasses released by live stock alone doesn't take into account the huge swathes of forest which are destroyed not only to house these animals, but also to grow feed. These forests are burned which releases large amounts of C02 and also takes away one of the best natural converters of carbon dioxide to oxygen. Feeding humanity with plants would require significantly less land use.	Producing meat only has a substantial impact on Carbon Dioxide and methane emissions. There are greenhouse gases with 32,000 times the Greenhouse Warming Potential \(GWP\) of CO2 and 4,289 times the GWP of Methane. Other greenhouse gases should be our priority as carbon emissions are reversible if re-forestation and re-greening efforts are made. [ghginstitute.org](http://ghginstitute.org/2010/06/28/what-is-a-global-warming-potential/)	The fact that meat eating and production contributes to climate change is not an argument for complete abstention from eating meat, it is only an argument for reducing the impact of meat eating, either through reduction in per capital amounts eaten or more sustainable farming practices.	The net effects of climate change are not obviously bad. There's no reason to believe the climate is perfectly optimized the way it is.	1 kg of chicken produces 6,9 kg CO2 eq; 1 kg of vegetables about 1.5-2 kg CO2 eq \([www.greeneatz.com](http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html)\). However, chicken has about 3-5 times more calories and up to 10 times as much protein as many vegetables, meaning you need to consume less of it on a kg to kg basis. A single mile in an airplane produces about 24 kg CO2 eq \([blueskymodel.org](http://blueskymodel.org/air-mile)\), about the same as 2 pounds of beef - so one single domestic flight will usually offset a person's meat-related carbon emissions for a whole year.	If humans stopped producing meat, the livestock would not simply disappear overnight and many of the animals could return to nature and reproduce.	Livestock-born GHG emissions have mostly been interpreted isolated from their ecosystemic context, ignoring their negligible significance within the global balance. There is no [scientific evidence](https://www.intechopen.com/books/forage-groups/domestic-livestock-and-its-alleged-role-in-climate-change), whatsoever, that domestic livestock could represent a risk for the Earth’s climate.

Eating a plant-rich diet ranks as the [fourth-most effective way](http://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank) to combat climate change.

Good livestock husbandry can actually heal and protect land.	Transforming into a vegan diet may do very little to reduce climate change as business organisations may simply create artificial products for human consumption that may re-enforce the issue of greenhouse gasses and pollution thereby re-enforcing the issue of climate change rather than ending it and further adding to the poor diet in humans	The same source \(now down, reup here: [www.mdpi.com](http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/9/1550/s1)\) also shows that beef makes the biggest difference.

What is natural can be derived.

We don't have the sharp teeth, claws or short intestinal track of carnivores.

Humans, like herbivores, lack the sharp [claws](http://www.celestialhealing.net/physicalveg3.htm) of a carnivorous predator, used to hunt down and kill prey.	While correct, this observation does not imply a prescription. Humans do not restrict themselves to activities that their bodies are optimized to do, but rather perform a whole range of activities, that the human body is not naturally meant for.	Humans aren't very successful at eating vegetables either \(as compare to, say, a cow\). These are the pains of being omnivores, and mean that humans cannot concentrate on only one kind of food. Thus, meat is an essential part of our diet. See [www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html).	Human's digestive system is designed to eat meat therefore eating meat is fundamental to good health.

Adaptation to new circumstances and opportunities is a hallmark of evolution, and thus nature in action. A changing diet that overcomes the physical adaptation to a previous diet is thus natural.

Human trafficking also brings many people pleasure; however, it is morally reprehensible because the pleasure comes at a horrific cost. Eating meat merely because it is pleasurable is not a strong pro meat consumption argument.	pro	The value of human life comes from a mutual agreeement to not kill each other, despite the uncomfortable ways that some humans may get pleasure from this practice. However, animals cannot make such agreements since to them, we can always be reduced to being either threats or just plain food. Therefore, there is no harm in getting pleasure from the meat acquired through the killing of an animal since it's the closest we can get to a mutual agreement.	Eating meat is not analogous to human trafficking, except on that one minor point.	According to utilitarianism the cost of human trafficking outweighs the good it creates which makes it morally reprehensible. The pleasure of eating meat does not come at the same horrific cost of human trafficking and therefore the overall utility to society is increased which makes eating meat a moral act.	Human trafficking brings no pleasure to anyone other than those with psychological damage who enjoy human suffering or those who deliberately ignore the cost of the trade to reap the dubious benefits. Neither of these groups are a majority and are certainly nowhere near the same size as those who enjoy meat.	Animals have no conscious awareness of their own death and are thus unaffected by the same human fear and dread experienced by slaves or others being trafficked for other reasons. Animals have little concept of freedom and it's opposite: oppression. Horror is a conscious, thinking reaction of humans and one not shared by any but the most intelligent animals which, as a result, we do not farm.

If we accept that humans are capable of greater emotions, then it isn't far-fetched to think that humans gain more from eating meat than animals lose from dying.	Suffering is not a necessity in the process by any means.

farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.	3_1.2.2.	Farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.	pro	Many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. Demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.	A 2012 study, examining the impact of a typical week’s eating, showed that plant-based diets are [better for the environment](https://www.vegsoc.org/eatingsustainably) than those based on meat.	Livestock have severe effects on their immediate environment, causing issues such as  [overgrazing, compaction, and erosion](http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html).	The production of meat consumes disproportionately more resources than the production of crops.	The vast amount of land required for animal agriculture leads to greater amounts of habitat loss.	There are many things that people do that have negative impacts on the environment which we would not want to complete stop doing.  For example, farming plants and trees, mining for construction, manufacturing of consumer electronics, etc. The negative impacts on the environment of farming animals is not a sufficient reason for the contention that all meat consumption should stop.	Many farm animals don't have their own native, wild habitat, and removing them from their farm habitat, by releasing them into the wild would very likely result in severe environmental, and ecological disruption. Many of these livestock would likely fail to survive in the wild, and others would likely displace existing species of plants and animals.	Many approaches to farming plants leads to monocultural agriculture practices that have a harmful impact on the wider environment.	There is no moral imperative for the environment to remain in stasis or for us regard it as 'fundamentally' in need of preserving so. Heat death awaits the entire universe.	In many cases land is best suited \(or only suited\) to farming meat; meaning that converting it to crops would be less efficient and thus cause greater environmental harms.	Plants can be grown in vertical farms, whereas animals cannot right now. Vertical farms use significantly less land through stacking.	Vegan foods offer little waste at the end since all of it could be turned to compost. This contrasts with the by-products of meat \(organs, fat, and bones\) that need to be re-purposed \(such as pet food\) for them not to get thrown away.	Eating meat causes human suffering, particularly in poor communities. Health problems in communities living near to animal agriculture operations and psychological problems in abbatoir workers.	Current industrialized fishing is responsable for getting many species of fish and other sea animals near extinction if not extinct already, which is detrimental to ocean's ecosystem.	If the impact is local, then the decision to prohibit meat eating and/or production should be local. This argument is relevant only to local policy and has no bearing on the absolute morality of meat eating and production.	Avoiding eating animals will help global bio-diversity in a big way. No longer will the planet be saturated with a few breeds of cows, chickens etc.	Regenerative livestock farmers worldwide are responsible for rehabilitating enormous tracts of land and in some cases helping bring at risk species of wildlife back into areas. I'm yet to see many grain and veg farmers to have a similar awareness.

The production of meat consumes disproportionately more resources than the production of crops.	pro	[77%](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/chart-shows-worlds-land-used/) of the worlds agricultural land is given over to livestock production.	Meat production will always be less calorie-efficient than vegetarian food production, since grain must be produced to feed meat animals.	While the practices of meat production in high-income industrialised countries tend to be resource inefficient, meat production in other countries is [a lot more efficient](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/09/03/it-does-not-take-7-kg-of-grain-to-make-1-kg-of-beef-be-very-careful-with-your-statistics/#1fc7709d5f0d). Rather than ceasing production altogether, we should ban inefficient methods of production.	A lot of the world's crops are currently used for animal feed, rather than human consumption.	Irrigation systems channel a catchment's water to agricultural uses rather than lead it follow it's natural path over a landscape. This deprives natural water ways and landscapes of their water supply and degrades local ecosystems.	Agricultural use of water disrupts the water table equilibrium and leads to [desertification](https://www.greenfacts.org/en/desertification/l-2/4-causes-desertification.htm) and [salinification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity_in_Australia).	It takes [100,000](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) liters of water to produce one kilogram of grain-fed beef.	[It takes](https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/12/livestock) two kg of grain to produce one kg of chicken, and between five and twenty kg of grain to produce one pound of beef.	There are countries where 99.9% of farming is grass fed. Industrial farming need not rely on grain - the nutrients are better, and the animals happier if you don't. Free range. Ethical farming practices would have one trying to replicate natural conditions. IMO, the same applies to agriculture, and recreating ecoystems/permaculture. We shouldn't I think, aim for the cheapest system - we should aim for the best system, to live on the earth, like we intend to stay here.	Trophic levels are important to consider here. As plants are consumed to feed an animal only ~10% of the energy is available for the animal. In other words, a strictly meat only diet would require 10 times the plant matter; 100 times if eating a predator.	Meat is inefficient. In growing animals for meat consumption the animal will always consume a significantly larger energy content in plant matter than can be obtained from the meat of that animal \(less than 5%\). This is due to the animal wasting massive quantities of energy in heating, digestion and movement.	The demand for, and pollution of, water resources from farming animals is immense.	Energy obtained from meat is second hand energy. It was first processed through a plant that was eaten after. And in each level of the chain some of the energy is dissipated.	Meat production uses twice as much land, water, and feed to produce the same amount of [calorie intake](https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/12/livestock) as other foods.	The amount of crops \(soy, corn, others\) that is fed to farm animals could feed more people if directly fed to humans. Therefore, meat aggravates world hunger and veganism can contribute to [ending world hunger](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cutting-back-on-meat-consumption-could-help-end-hunger-by-2030-experts_us_55f3424ee4b077ca094f27a5).	Animals are able to produce calories from kinds of plants and organic matter that humans cannot. Plants also do not rely on the seasons to live, breed, or be harvested thus creating for a more stable food source.	According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN \(FAO\), 60% of the world’s agricultural land is used for grazing livestock and 1/4 of the world’s croplands is used for animal feed. In total, 2/3 of the world’s agricultural area and 1/3 of the total global land area is used for [maintaining livestock](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2008/f/factory_farming_and_the_environment_1999.pdf).

How the animals are raised does not affect the conversion ratio of organisms on different trophic levels, but it does have an impact on the overall efficiency on a farm. The claim that animals == inefficiency is a zero-sum outlook on farm production, which only holds true for certain kinds of agriculture. In systems-based agriculture an animal is one part of the system, using inputs \(e.g. grass\), but creating inputs for other parts of the system \(e.g. manure\). This can be highly efficient.	We measure those conversation ratios [by burning the material](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/) in question and measuring the heat outputs.

the common practices underlying the production of meat \(massive livestock farming\) are unethical.	3_1.3.1.4.1.2.	The common practices underlying the production of meat \(massive livestock farming\) are unethical.	pro	Many animals raised for food are not slaughtered or kept humanely.	Because egg and meat production are separated by modern production practices the males of egg-laying chickens are often [shredded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) shortly after hatching as they are not needed.	Raising animals in confinement, deprived of sunlight, natural soil and freedom to move, is cruel and against their nature.	Consuming meat from organic livestock farming could help to mitigate these risks.	Animals on farms are routinely [mutilated with no anesthetic.](http://freefromharm.org/animal-products-and-ethics/a-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-humane-farming-myth/) The animals are castrated, given nose rings and ear tags, dehorned and debeaked, all of which are painful exercises carried out on most farms.	Cows have been seen to have incredibly strong bonds, particularly between mothers and their calves. On these farms the calves are often taken away from the mother to be killed and there are numerous reports of [mother cows calling and searching](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/factory-farming/cows/hidden-lives-cows/) for their babies.	Unnatural methods of farming could be easily curbed if industrial nations consumed less meat. Everyone being on a meatless diet is not necessary.	Cruel practices and incidents of animal abuse have been repeatedly exposed in animal agriculture. The true incidence is probably greater than those shown up through investigation.	Stressed out livestock will produce lower quality meat and less of it. It is in farmers' best interests to make sure their livestock are comfortable and safe.	Many meat producing companies use misleading titles like "Cage Free" and "Free Range" to make buyers feel better. Meanwhile instead of having individual cages that barely allow for movement, animals are crammed into huge pens where they often are so close that they bump into each other constantly. Either way you put it, it is inhumane and unnecessary to continue this practice for the sake of enjoying the taste.	Unethical common practices suggest more ethical practices exist, and thus this is an argument to change practices not halt farming of animals.	Animals in the slaughter chute that sense mortal danger feel fear—terror, in fact. That fear manifests as rushes of adrenaline and other biological processes may lock that fear into the meat that carnivore humans eat. According Jess Zimmerman, writing in Atlas Obscura, botched slaughtering of pigs—the pig survives the first attempt to kill it—causes less saleable, bad-tasting, acidic “pale soft exudative” meat, i.e., pork from frightened animals. [Why Meat from Scared Animals Tastes Worse](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-scared-animals-taste-worse)	This claim depends on examples of treatment that is cruel.  Many of the examples of farming practices viewed as cruel serve a function that benefits the animal's well being.  For instance calves are separated from their mother at birth because we are able to prevent infections better while they increase antibodies, killing is necessary but pain free, animals are restrained, but in many cases are free to exhibit normal social behavior. Producers know that reducing stress increases output.

The [Humane Slaughter Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Slaughter_Act) in the US has been a federal law for over 60 years.

Parenthood problems could, therefore, be avoided by sedating and giving more "humane" treatment to animals.	This is a biological response rather than emotional. Mother cows udders become full of milk when the calf is removed, and the mother is looking for her calf simply for relief. The same is true of removed calves calling for their mothers for milk. Once the calves begin to eat solid food they stop searching for the mother, and once the mothers' milk production stops they stop searching for their calves. If there was an emotional response, we could assume some pairs would continue to search.

The idea that eating meat is less civilized than not eating meat is a subjective value judgement, which is neither sufficiently justified here, nor widely accepted.	Evolutionary speaking, hominids only had access to meat after coming down from the trees, which means eating meat came after eating fruits and vegetables, and is therefore more civilized. Moreover, eating meat required the invention of weapons to hunt, and the discovery of fire, furthering the correlation between meat and civilization.

buying and consuming processed meat from intensive livestock farming is anything but natural.	3_1.4.1.	Buying and consuming processed meat from intensive livestock farming is anything but natural.	pro	We may only talk of a 'natural' process when observing the ways of indigenous tribes such as the Inuit, who hunt and prepare their meat themselves, and do not over-consume or waste their prey. The majority of humankind today do not share these same, natural practices.	Raising animals in confinement, deprived of sunlight, natural soil and freedom to move, is cruel and against their nature.	Consuming meat from organic livestock farming could help to mitigate these risks.	Meat requires [preservatives](http://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/_Documents/industry/preservative_use_in_processed_meats.pdf) so it does not spoil.	Unnatural methods of farming could be easily curbed if industrial nations consumed less meat. Everyone being on a meatless diet is not necessary.	Chaffing male chickens right after their hatching is anything but natural.	By the same logic one could argue that vegetarianism through the consumption of milk produced and food grown on large-scale farms is anything but natural.	Carnivores have a place in the ecosystem, but the human practice of eating domestic meat does not satisfy the requirement of ecological benefit and therefore becomes harmful at scale.	The potential of human's progress has already been there from the very beginning, like the potential of a flower is already in its seed. So how humans live today is the real natural way, not the underdeveloped states before.

Therefore our ancestors were more gatherers than hunters.	pro	It might be easier to gather a plant, but it is not easier to plant than to hunt.

Hunting could potentially take minutes/hours, whereas farming involves constant attention over months.	From experience in the bush, it is easier and more efficient to get your daily needs for nutrition by hunting and eating animals than it is by gathering plants. Therefore I would argue that our ancestors met their caloric needs primarily through animal consumption.

Because animals feel, they should be treated according to [utilitarian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), which advocates maximising pleasure and minimising suffering for all sentient beings.	Animals from a wide range of species have been shown to experience [emotions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201306/universal-declaration-animal-sentience-no-pretending) including happiness, grief, empathy and jealousy.	Sentience is not a sufficient condition for having rights. For example, ants are sentient, but it would be unreasonable to say that they have a right to life.	We should grant rights to all sentient beings because there is no consistent way of differentiating between humans \(who have rights\) and other sentient beings.	Animals are sentient, but not rational, therefore cannot predict suffering or conceive their fates in slaughter houses. Rights emerge from the prediction of suffering.	Animals are not as self aware as humans, so they would not be aware of their coming death until it's already happened. Especially as the methods of doing so are quick and painless.	Non-human animals, just like humans, are sencient and have a conscience.

Thus, utilitarian ethics suggest that humans should keep eating meat.	Humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the sublimation of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner. Animals are not, thus they are unequal to humans on a moral level.	Act utilitarian [Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_%28book%29) argues that the Basic Principle of Equality should be extended to nonhuman animals and that it would demand us to equally consider the interests of animals.	Billions of animals are brutalized and tortured on factory farms every year. Since the only pleasure humans get from eating meat is gustatory pleasure, it is doubtful that the pain and suffering that these animals experience can ever be justified according to utilitarian principles.	Utilitarian ethics is not only a disputed way of thinking, but is very difficult to implement \(for instance, what is the appropriate time span of pain/pleasure that we are computing?\), especially in nature, which does not care about utilitarianism.	We are beginning to find evidence that [plants feel as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrrSAc-vjG4) If plants and animals both feel, we cannot afford to treat them both with utilitarian ethics, we have to eat something! Animals are not more deserving of care than plants. No matter what we do, we'll be making an ethical compromise and killing a living, feeling being.	Many animals are incapable of feeling pain. Depending on the definition of sentient this may not be able to be applied to meat from any source in general.	Farm [animals feel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness) pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are [sentient](http://www.livescience.com/39481-time-to-declare-animal-sentience.html) and intelligent beings, thus utilitarianism can be applied to them. \([psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201306/universal-declaration-animal-sentience-no-pretending)\)	A pleasure maximizing ethical paradigm might just as easily justify breeding livestock for food, raising them in a way that maximizes their happiness, and killing them in the most humane manner possible. By bringing a life into this world you are increasing total happiness and satisfying the tastes/preferences of humans who desire meat as food.	The argument has been made that plants are [equally sentient and intelligent](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/aug/04/plants-intelligent-sentient-book-brilliant-green-internet), even though not in the same sense as humans and animals are.

eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.	3_1.8.	Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.	pro	Farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.	Unlike other animals, humans are morally conscious of their behaviour and are thus subject to [moral standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality), meaning they cannot justify meat consumption on the basis of \(arguments such as\) convenience or their own mental superiority.	The common practices underlying the production of meat \(massive livestock farming\) are unethical.	All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.	For most people, eating meat is needless and the needless killing of beings with a will to live is immoral.	Conscious vegetarianism facilitates compassion towards other living beings and discourages us from viewing them as mere ingredients to a recipe.	Morality is subjective, so eating meat is not necessarily immoral.	Ceasing to eat meat would mean that vast quantities of livestock would die without being replaced as they are unable to survive effectively outside of human agriculture.	A great many human activities cause the deaths of animals. A focus on meat leads to moral inconsistency and potential hypocrisy.	Given that meat is still the primary food source for many people in less fortunate countries. Given that human bodies vary wildly in which foods they will process more efficiently. Given that some conditions will actually make eating plant only foods a negative life choice for many. It is cruel and immoral to presume that no human should eat meat under any circumstances. The above claim completely ignores the quality of life of other humans, making the claim itself cruel and immoral.	Eating meat is not immoral; the production of meat can be cruel but the consumption is not.	Consuming vegetables is also cruel to both the plants and to the workers responsible for the agricultural process.	If everyone who cares about the ethical treatment of animals were to stop eating meat, then the only people farming and consuming meat would be those who lack compassion for the animals. Human's relationship with nature should be one of mutual respect and compassion - this will never happen if those who would put this in practice choose instead to have no symbiotic relationship with nature at all.	While much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. Ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources \(i.e. free range farming\) that afford animals the same \(if not better\) quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.	We should not rely on other lives \(such as eating animals\) to progress our own. Finding a way to not depend on others for people's existence allows for independence. Then people will not feel compelled to resort to cruelty to survive.	The effects of this cruel treatment are twofold. Not only does it involve the suffering and murder of billions on an annual basis but also negatively impacts the environment \(methane and phosphorous outputs, deforestation\). Ultimately hurting non-domestic animal species and ourselves in the process	Take the flesh that the average meat eater consumes and make them take the action of the rearing and slaughtering of the life form behind that flesh, other than letting a fish suffocate most today would find themselves unable. A wrong they can not replicate if not delegated.	So many people are worried about animals but don't even think twice when walking by a homeless person on the streets. It's preposterous. How about we worry about our own kind first and then start talking about animals.	The statement is unclear as it is not specified what the "majority of cases" are. What delineates those from the others, supposedly not cruel or not immoral?	Moral values are typically pertinent to particular individuals, groups, religions or schools of thought. There are no universally accepted moral values that condemn eating meat or treating animals in any particular way. Therefore the statement that eating meat can involve immoral treatment, is false.	The ignorance and confusion about how animals are treated may have been deliberately caused by the meat industry [lack of transparency](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/09/magazine/meat-industry-transparency-fight.html) and [misleading advertising.](https://www.ecowatch.com/dairy-industry-facts-2525727633.html)	For those who eat meat, it may also mean that they neither have a developed empathy nor a developed compassion - leaving farm animals out of their [circles of compassion](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/28/einstein-circles-of-compassion/), or just that they don't have [reliable sources of information](https://www.viva.org.uk/blog/meat-myths). \(e.g. ["suicide food".](https://suicidefood.blogspot.com/)\)	Relating to the standards of good behaviour \(not killing / not imprisoning\), fairness \(not profiting on others pain / not imposing artificial insemination to females or robbing them their byproducts -eggs or milk\), and honesty \(not enslaving entire species -farm animals / not robbing other intelligent and sentient beings offspring to subdue them as well\), [i.e. morals](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/moral), eating meat is wrong, especially when there are [alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_meat_substitutes).

That study relies on a 'best case' farming practice that seeks to minimise animal deaths and protect crops through all stages of vegetable production. In almost all cases those practices are not followed in mainstream agriculture.	That study included, "animals slaughtered directly for food, and animals killed in the harvesting of crops... predators killed in defense of livestock, animals prevented from existing by the destruction of their habitat, and human deaths from food poisoning, disease, or accidents on farms or in slaughterhouses." It does not include intentionally killed pest animals, which would likely make a difference for both sources, especially if they included insects, which they did not.	While the study suggests fewer animals are harmed in production of vegetarian products, the authors themselves recognize limitations in their own study. They clearly state that no accurate estimates exist of how many animals are actually harmed due to farming practices.	The study talks about calories. Vegetables are more "calorie dense" \(as in calories/kg\) than meats. If we look at the numbers for protein production, the result would be the opposite, since meat is much more protein dense than vegetables. Calories alone are not sufficient for a healthy diet, and protein malnutrition can be fatal.	The study also does not take into account broader environmental impacts of plant agriculture like destruction of animal habitat for farmland, leaching of agricultural chemicals \(even fertilizer leaked into nearby areas like water source can cause negative impacts like increased algae growth which can choke out fish species\), and removal of insects which are often basal components of food webs of that area.	Animals per calorie is an absurd metric. 251.1 zooplankton are insignificant compared to 2.55 blue whales.	This is a severely misleading characterization of the study. A single cow provides far more than 1000 calories. A single pound of hamburger contains 1000 calories.

Red meat animals feed on pasture, which requires next to no upkeep. In contrast, farming vegetables requires the use of pesticides that kill massive amounts of insects and/or similar measures that kill birds.	Measuring against kg of usable protein is misleading, since meat has higher concentrations of proteins relative to other nutrients. So the gap between meat and grains is not that large.	99% of animals raised for red meat spend at least some of their lives on feedlots. The grains they are fed are just as responsible for killing sentient animals.	That article only refers to Australia where cattle spend significantly more time grazing in fields. That does not hold for animals in factory farms fed a diet from farmed plant products.	The article linked to is full of misinformation. Check the comments section for refutation of nearly every point. One point is the many mice being killed by harvest of grains, yet  "the only fields a mouse might be attracted to would be wheat or corn. Since both of those are harvested by machines which cut the stalks several inches above the ground. Any self respecting mouse would have no problem avoiding the harvester unless it is suicidal."	Modern urban farming using techniques such as [hydroponics](http://www.hortidaily.com/article/1177/900-crops-of-lettuce-per-square-meter,-and-only-4-laborers-per-hectare), aquaponics, and microfarming does not directly or indirectly harm animals, and yields far greater crop yields than traditional farming techniques.	This claim and the supporting article are very specific to beef cattle reared in Australia where pastoral lands are abundant. It doesn't hold when you consider the land required for free range animal rearing to satisfy the global appetite for meat.	This depends on the food. Hand-picked crops like strawberries and peas do not harm as many animals — if anything they support life because beneficial insects are brought to the farm to help the crops grow.

all animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.	3_1.8.4.	All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.	pro	Some animals, who due to their reproduction disturb a natural balance, need to be killed in order to preserve biodiversity. This is the case with rabbits on the German island [Norderney](http://de.alamy.com/stock-photo-rabbits-on-a-meadow-oryctolagus-cuniculus-norderney-island-lower-saxony-78982277.html) where the rabbits were accidentally brought to the island by humans.	Animals are not morally equivalent to humans and therefore do not possess an equal natural right to live.	Most animals whose meat is eaten have been the property of humans. Their property rights conflict with animal rights.	Humans currently give different consideration to animals such as pets \(whom we care for\) and farm animals \(whom we eat\). This is an arbitrary line to draw, as both have the same right to live.	Humans are at the top of the food chain, which means that they are merely following the natural order of things when they kill and eat other animals.	The limited sentience of most animal species means that they can be used to fulfill human desires, such as through farming, as long as it is not unnecessarily cruel.	Because animals feel, they should be treated according to [utilitarian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), which advocates maximising pleasure and minimising suffering for all sentient beings.	Animals do not have "rights" at all. They live in a state of eat or be eaten. Rights do not exist in the natural world at all, only in the socially constructed world that humans have created for themselves.	"Human rights" are not laws of the universe but rather a practical tool humans use to govern interaction with each other. They are a means of outlining and governing acceptable behavior so that we may live peacefully with each other. We can do this because we can communicate with each other and hold each other accountable. We cannot communicate with other species and hold them accountable in the same way yet.  A wolf does not understand, and will not respect, a universal right to life.	Even if animals did live free of human slaughter, they would most likely die due to consumption by predators anyways so you might as well use the animals in a way that benefits humans.	It would be good to eradicate certain Mosquitos and parasites, so they cannot have such a right.	A chicken or cow doesn't have any frame of reference, and hence doesn't know what a good or bad life is. We like to attribute meaning to our own lifes and subsequently, animals lives too. If a chicken does not know what it is like to live in the wilderness then is it suffering inside?	Humans are not superior to any other animal, they are simply a small part of a whole ecosystem. As such, they have no legitimate right to kill animals as they please.	Imagine we could harvest meat from a meat plant. If you believe it is more ethical to harvest meat from a plant than from an animal, then you recognize that harvesting meat from animals is unethical.	It is our moral duty to minimize the suffering we cause to conscious beings. To the degree to which a being has the capacity to suffer, we have a responsibility to minimize the suffering we cause it.	This statement is illogically selective. Why it should apply to just animals versus all living things? Why do all plants or microbes not have a right to live and be free of suffering?	Animals bred for meat would not exist if their meat was not to be consumed. Wherein does their right to life reside if nobody is willing to create the circumstances of their existence?	Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.	Animals are sentient beings - they feel pain and have complex emotional lives. Many have family structures and are able to bond. Killing them for our pleasure when alternatives exist is immoral and archaic.	Meat comes from a living source that only dies in order for us to sustain our own living. We say it is morally incorrect to kill another human being but for an animal it is okay? This belief is hypocritical in nature.	Without the raising of animals for slaughter, they wouldn't have had a life in the first place. They are fed and raised to maturity.	Animals feel pain. And if you suggest that they are inferior therefore you have the right to do anything to them, you should also have the right to do anything you want with mentally challenged people or any other human who is inferior to you. Society is better than in the past exactly because of empathy from which morality arises. It is time to get past our arrogance towards other animals.	70 billion animals [are sacrificed every year for consumption](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/3640540/ciwf_strategic_plan_20132017.pdf).	Ethics persuade us that we have a duty not to exploit anyone, and beyond that, a duty to actively help all victims of exploitation from their plight to the best of our ability. Animals in this case are innocent victims of mass exploitation.	The type of intensive agriculture required to produce vegetarian food on a scale to feed current populations inherently causes the death of animals. To plant acres of soy one must displace every single animal living there, eradicate every bird, mouse, squirrel that would eat the crop, poison every insect, grind up every creature in the path of the harvester, etc. Farming is an ecological disaster that represents death to every living being that is not the crop.

Conscious vegetarianism facilitates compassion towards other living beings and discourages us from viewing them as mere ingredients to a recipe.	pro	It is hard to feel sympathy for being one never sees, or interacts with, even if the alternative is only seeing them as part of a meal.	Many who eat meat also feel compassion towards other animals. It is very possible to research where your meat comes from to ensure that no cruel methods were used in raising the animal, and in the case of hunting, thinning the population allows for expansion of resources, allowing the survivors a greater ability to thrive. This also allows their offspring more room to grow with less competition.	Conscious vegetarianism facilitates a lack of compassion toward other living beings because they see plants as mere ingredients to a recipe.	Specifically, it facilitates the reduction of suffering among living beings capable of suffering. Reducing suffering is good.	The above claimant presumes to know what human beings "feel" when they eat meat, and how those human beings view life. It is an inaccurate representation, and therefore it is invalid.	Conscious living facilitates compassion toward other living beings. Vegetarianism is not a necessary component of this.	By consuming farmed meat you are [ingesting the suffering and trauma those animal experienced in their short lives](http://sciencenordic.com/meat-stressed-animals-unhealthy) which has potential metaphysical consequences we cannot comprehend.	Eating someone or parts of someone is contradictory to compassion. Compassion involves the understanding of suffering and its reduction as much as possible. It is unlikely that there is not any suffering associated with the steps involved in eating a living being.	Love for fellow Earthlings would include the notion that our lives are precious and, therefore, we are not something to be eaten.	The thinking man must oppose all cruel customs no matter how deeply rooted in tradition and surrounded by a halo.

Specifically, it facilitates the reduction of suffering among living beings capable of suffering. Reducing suffering is good.	pro	Not all moral systems are centred on the reduction of suffering.	If reducing suffering is the only measure of good, the logical conclusion is that we must end all life to end all suffering. This is inherently wrong.	If reducing suffering is good, but we do not have to end suffering entirely, then responsible farming of domesticated livestock accomplishes this end, as few domesticated animals living in these circumstances will suffer as much, or die as miserably as their wild counterparts.	If the only moral factor is 'reducing suffering is good', then a responsible hunter who kills their prey quickly is more moral than a vegan who eats foods harvested from large fields where animals are caught and maimed by harvesting equipment. The hunter is more responsible than that same group because field crops cause animals to reproduce more quickly, only to have their food supply eliminated as winter approaches, with few natural predators nearby to bring them swifter death than starvation.	I don't think we can say definitively that it reduces suffering. Are plants capable of suffering? I know some would say so. Are insects capable of suffering? How would you define suffering? Is one creature's suffering more relevant than another's? Which is worse, the death and suffering of a million insects, a hundred mice, or a single cow?

Domesticated animals, including animals raised for meat, [show significantly lower levels of the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine than their wild counterparts](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/bambi-or-bessie-are-wild-animals-happier/).	If domesticated animals are raised ethically in a way as to have reasonable lives, then they are allowed to exist and experience life, where in a world without meat farming they probably would not.	The rearing of animals need not be seen as 'solely for eating', with additional responsibilities requiring a reasonable life. If meat consumption ceased, it is unlikely the farm animals would be reintroduced to the wild, they would simply vanish from existence.	In the wild, there are no such concepts as compassion or malice. There is only nature, which is primal and brutal. A swift death at the hands of a hunter or farmer who will use the animal for food, clothing, etc. is a far better death than by natural predators, disease, or famine.

"Culture" is not important. Cultural behaviors can be positive or negative. The practice of female genital mutilation is not something we should strive to protect simply because it is part of the culture. Slavery was our culture once. People fought and died to preserve that culture, yet the culture was wrong, just as the culture of eating animal products is.	Culture should not dictate morality.	The cultural basis for meat consumption originated in hunter gatherer times. We no longer live in hunter gather societies and therefore dietary custom is an antiquated justification for meat consumption. Hunter gatherer meat consumption is more justified than agrarian meat consumption because meat was a scarcity that had to be earned; consequently it was the highlight of the meal. The amount of meat consumed is unnatural and is therefore at odds with the foundation of this cultural argument.	Slavery was once accepted by the society and their culture. This does not mean it is morally justified.	Not all cultural or religious values should be respected.  They are not equally valid.	People live traditionally and rarely stop to ask whether our traditions are blinding us from the reality of the cruel way we indirectly treat certain animals. At the root of their treatment is discrimination, which leads to exploitation and abuse. Eating animals in the modern world is cruel because it is no longer necessary to eat animals to survive and live a healthy life. If these animals we not bred into existence, there would be no need for them to exist in the wild.	Eating meat was necessary for survival. Many meat-eating cultures have some inherent respect for the animals they eat. If there is no longer a necessity to eat meat to survive, the slaughter is purely for gratification; we should reduce our consumption, and develop other ways of fulfilling our recreational eating desires.	More humans eat meat than choose to abstain from eating meat, and most abstention is poverty based. Whilst non-meat eaters are the more vocal and empassioned cohort on this issue, this does not make them the majority and societal intersubjective truths are generally determined by majority thought constructs. In other words, eating meats is okay because most humans believe it to be okay.	It's not ethically wrong since the definition of "Ethical" is "A set of moral values and principles that guide the human conduct in the society". Knowing that, the most part of the society eat meat and don't see any problem in this. We can declare it not ethically wrong.[Ethical Definition \( Brazil Website \)](https://www.suapesquisa.com/o_que_e/etica_conceito.htm)	The argument that something is part of a dominant culture was used to justify numerous evils of human history, from racism to corruption and the suppression of minorities.	According to [moral absolutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism), particular actions are intrinsically right or wrong.	As there are no absolute standards for judging right and wrong, good and bad, as these terms are products of social agreement, individuals can only use their culture and the values / attitudes it has created for moral guidance. From this point of view, the dominant culture thus explains and justifies behavior.	The amounts of culturally-prescribed meat, for example at rituals, are limited and thus come with marginal negative effects. There is nothing to justify.

vegetarian diets directly and indirectly contribute to better health outcomes for all humans.	3_1.10.	Vegetarian diets directly and indirectly contribute to better health outcomes for all humans.	pro	The meat industry has harmful effects on the physical and mental health of its workers. Eradication of this industry would reduce these harms.	Scientists have concluded that vegetarian diets can in fact [provide benefits](http://freefromharm.org/featured-articles/catching-up-with-science-burying-the-humans-need-meat-argument/) in the treatment and prevention of certain diseases.	People who must already follow [restrictive diets](http://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/) due to medical conditions such as IBS or IBD cannot consume most plant-based or dairy sources of protein, making it necessary for them to resort to meat-based proteins.	Meat consumption itself is not unhealthy. It strongly depends on the [amount](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/meat.aspx) consumed as well as its origin - whether it is from industrial livestock farming or organic farming.	Eating meat is linked to increased risks for certain types of cancer.	The farming of meat can fuel the spread of disease and ingestion of drugs that may pose significant risks to human health.	Meat effectively delivers important nutrients for humans.	[Statistically](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088278.PDF) those who abstain from a meat based diet are exposed to higher health risk hazards.	Meat-eaters suffer more frequently from various types of [food poisoning](http://www.celestialhealing.net/physicalveg3.htm) than vegetarians.	Living without meat reduces [metabolic risk](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/34/5/1225.abstract) factors and thus reduces the likelihood of strokes, diabetes, and heart conditions.	Not all vegetarians have a healthy diet. There is a lot of meatless junk food available. Hence, an absence of meat in a diet does not equal a healthier diet.	The [fact](http://qz.com/91123/vegetarians-live-longer-but-its-not-because-they-dont-eat-meat/) that vegetarians live longer \(up to nine years\) is not only due to their meatless diet, but also to the fact that they are more likely to exercise, smoke less and drink less alcohol.	When looking at smaller sample sizes and more diverse diets there is little to suggest that meat is inherently unhealthy.	Meat consists of a lot of protein. Therefore, its consumption leads to increased intake of protein. [The China Study](https://www.amazon.co.uk/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660) measured the ideal daily intake to be 8 to 10 percent, whereas most people consume twice as much.	Avoidance of all meat is a luxury good, only realistic in a healthy manner, in rich societies. In poor societies practicing vegetarianism, it often correlates with malnutrition. In most societies, this claim is both arrogant and moralizing, condemning poor countries to malnutrition, contributing to expanding in equality.	Vegetarian foods are nutritionally superior to meat.	Meat is dangerous in that it increases the risk of injuries to those who eat meat.	Assuming that vegans are healthier and do live longer, these extra years of life mean that they continue to damage the environment. This makes it less ethical, not more, to remove meat from people's diets.	Whether or not people have better or worse health outcomes due to their diet is irrelevant to the claim that people should completely stop eating meat. It is only an argument to restructure health policy to reduce meat consumption or encourage veganism.	Vegetarian diets are only more beneficial for the health of an individual if they are [well balanced](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/tc/vegetarian-diets-how-can-vegetarians-eat-a-balanced-diet), [and if compared to an unbalanced omnivorous diet.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3967195/) The essence in the question of health is not that which is more healthier: eating, or not eating animal related products, but the overall quality and composition of a diet.	You can eat healthy and eat meat. It is just that most people do not follow diets and they would probably not follow them if they were forced to be vegetarian.	A substantial population require meat in their diet for health reasons, as thousands of [stories show](http://meatheals.com/).	[We are not meant to eat meat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58) A lot of people have explained how we have not developed biologically to hunt, consume or digest meat, here is a 30 minute explanation from a former meat lover turned vegan. Fridges should be gardens not morgues.	[All diets](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/95/3/614/4578300) generally lead to better health outcomes compared to people who do not follow a restrictive diet, because people on a diet make conscious decisions about their food.	A vegetarian diet might lead to better health outcomes, but for some who live in countries where getting vegan/vegetarian food easily isn't an option, a non-veg diet is a trade off between health and convenience.

A major [study by Oxford University](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/201603_Plant_based_diets) concluded that universal adoption of vegetarian diets could avoid 7.3 million deaths per year by 2050.	There is much we do not yet understand about gut health and how the body metabolises and interacts with foods.	Individual studies might show advantages to a vegetarian diet, but [literature reviews](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/science-compared-every-diet-and-the-winner-is-real-food/284595/) show no significant gains when all the various popular diets are compared to each other. Many different diets based primarily on the idea that we should eat whole food and mostly plants all show substantial health gains. We don't need to remove meat to achieve the health outcomes -- we just need to make sure we get enough plants and focus on unprocessed foods.	Eating meat is no longer necessary due to the range of meat substitutes on offer.	The [American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://freefromharm.org/featured-articles/catching-up-with-science-burying-the-humans-need-meat-argument/) has stated that well planned vegetarian diets are nutritionally adequate and appropriate for individuals at all stages of life.	In the long run \(many years into the diet\), vegetarianism makes people depressed, as stated by Lierre Keith in her book The Vegetarian Myth.	The idea of a meatless diet being weak or deficient in protein is not accurate as we know some of the strongest animals on Earth are vegetarian.	This health claim was promoted by vegetarian societies that deceptively qualified their dietary recommendation with "well-planned" when this doesn't belong to any single food group.	The alleged health benefits of vegetarianism came from caloric restriction and fibre, both of which can be gotten from omnivory and carnivory, whereas alcohol and tobacco are both plant products that were arbitrarily excluded in the vegetarian diet.	Freefromharm.org contradicts itself where it says our species needs the same nutrients but then some of us are allergic or diseased \[but doesn't say so by genetics\].  Thus some lack the ability to digest lactose in milk, gluten in wheat, beta-carotene in several crops, albumen in egg white, glucose-6-phosphate in fava, and lectins in seeds and nightshades.	The [phytate](https://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=phytate%7Cphytic+rickets%7Cpellagra%7Cberiberi) antinutrient in whole grains has killed 100,000s by [pellagra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellagra#History) and [ric](http://austinpublishinggroup.com/pediatrics/fulltext/download.php?file=ajp-v1-id1001.pdf)[k](https://books.google.com/books?id=4IhXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA443&lpg=PA443)[ets](https://books.google.com/books?id=zp30zkTvfmMC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90).  Tannin antinutrients destroy thiamine in the bran that has the same phytate which without the bran causes beriberi.	A vegetarian diet requires a complete set of disparate ingredients that, when taken in bad proportion or alone, cause heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cavities, osteoporosis, kidney stones, fatigue, brain fog, and malnutrition.  The nutritional supplements with the diet suffer from different bioavailabilities such that amine and vitamin compounds cause overdose of calcium and transition metals whereas carbonate and citrate compounds are not absorbed well.	The same species does require very different nutrients.  Freefromharm.org will quote-mine nutritionists, rather than doctors or scientists, for requirements when it serves their position even if it supports opposite premises: milk is only for babies which is why adults lose the ability to digest milk \(same species\) but everyone needs the same nutrients.

The studies that claim animal over plant diets use more resources such as fuel, irrigation, land, and fertilizer discount the fuel spent to transport crops from the climates suited to them like volcanic, tropical, and marine environments \(e.g. 9000 miles for coconuts between Oceania and America\) and the greater land and fertilizer use for human crops on soils that don't natively support staples.	India has a wide adoption of vegetarianism but its lifespan lags France, whose diet is rich in saturated fat and livestock, by 20 years.  The leading cause of death in India is heart disease.

These animals spend a majority of their time eating and their stomachs are designed to process hard to digest plant matter. Humans are not designed to eat purely plants in the same way and therefore cannot subsist on the same diet and expect the same results.

comparing the lifestyle and diet of the inuit people to that of most meat consumers is a false equivalency. the source of their meat is vastly different from industrially produced meat found in grocery stores, and their daily lives are vastly different from the average meat consumer. even when adjusted by age, race, smoking, exercise, personal income, educational level, marital status, alcohol, and region, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4073139/) have shown that plant based diets lead to reduced health risks.	3_1.10.13.1.2.

The lifestyles of these groups are radically different from normal human populations in very many ways. The fact that they are healthy therefore does not prove that their consumption of meat does not harm them - it could simply be the case that the harm is offset by other aspects of their lifestyles.	pro	There is no baseline for 'normal human populations' . Every established ethnic and regional group has adapted their diet to their environment and available resources. Changes to these diets result in negative health effects and so whilst eating meat does not confer any advantage, ceasing its consumption will inflict a negative effect on their health.	For the group tests to be valid, they should also be checked for malnutrition in general, and also be tested with vegan equivalent supplements that offer a similar dose of iron, protein and other nutrients that those groups' existing diets are lacking.
