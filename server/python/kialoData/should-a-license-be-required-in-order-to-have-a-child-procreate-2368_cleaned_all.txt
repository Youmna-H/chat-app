A licensing system controlling procreation would enable the government to direct human evolution towards positive eugenic ends.	The practicalities of implementing such a policy would make it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to implement in some countries.	Parenting licenses will bring undue harm to people.	It would be fair towards people who \(have to\) adopt to make the procedure to choose for procreation equally complex.	A parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.	It is the duty of the state to maximize the quality of life of all its people.	Parenting licenses allow for earlier state intervention than current child protection processes. This is in the best interest of both child and parent\(s\), as well as society.

A right can't inflict harm. A right to be an irresponsible parent inflicts harms on children. It is therefore the duty of the government to minimise the number of irresponsible parents.	pro	There is no "right to be an irresponsible parent". There is a right to be a parent and parents are then free to raise their children as they see fit assuming they follow the law. The specific right to be a parent does not itself inflict the harm on the children, the parents do. Basically, if we hold that it is the rights that inflict harm then the logical extension of this would be complete totalitarianism.	Taking children from their families, as a licensing scheme would ultimately cause, also inflicts damage to them and there would likely be a large number of children taken for petty bureaucratic reasons. A policy like this would inflict more harm than it prevents.	In the US, one could use their right to bear arms to intimidate someone, without it undermining their rights.

Unconceived future children, either as specific intended children or as future generations, have no current ontological status and thus no current interests or rights.

The bodily autonomy of the parent comes at the expense of the bodily authority of the child. The purpose of the test is to limit the autonomy of the parents if it is deemed as harmful towards their unborn children.	Rights must be absolute, otherwise they are convenience and must be universally applicable, otherwise they are privileges.	Where they clash, children's rights should overrule parents' rights.	The potential harm to the child cannot be measured with absolute accuracy. In fact, it is impossible to determine if the rights of the child will be harmed at all, even if the parents fail to get the license. However, the harm to the parents is clear and fully realized. Therefore we should preference their rights.	Framing the claim to a right to procreate in a model of competing rights leads to a circular argument in which a nonexistent child could claim a right to prevent its own existence.

This is likely to lead to the homogenisation of society, as only those that fit a specific profile will be able to reproduce.	The idea of "positive ends" is subjective and therefore irrational.

As such, society has no right to make a parent's decision on whether or not to have a child with hereditary disorders, or indeed that child's right to exist.	The very fact that someone is willing to invoke eugenics as a positive outcome here is evidence to support exactly how it will be misused and should be avoided at all costs.	A licensing system should prevent the procreation of people with severe hereditary disorders, which it could do by requiring prospective biological parents to pass a basic physical health standard in order to be allowed to procreate.

a parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.	0_1.6.	A parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.	pro	A parenting license incentivises people to cover up or lie about their flaws, rather than seeking help.	If overall parenting improves, the drain on state resources is likely to decrease, resulting in better child services for those children still at risk.	The government-preferred parenting is not necessarily better parenting. Centralized solutions decided by governments are rarely better for individuals who do not fit the norms.	A form of a parenting licence system to dictate number of births has already been used in China. China is the only country with a suicide rate [higher](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-statistics.html) for females than males. This should raise questions regarding the impact of imposed fertility control on female mental health.	A parenting license encourages responsible family planning.	All parenting licenses can guarantee is short term, superficial changes in a person's lifestyle or parenting choices. This is not enough to make meaningful long-term change in their child's wellbeing.	A parenting license system will create clear, state-sanctioned guidance on what comprises good parenting.	Bad parenting results in harmful consequences for the child. Requiring a parent to obtain a license ensures a basic standard of parenting.	There is evidence from examining occupational licensing that increased licensing does not necessarily lead to higher quality. For example, one study found that occupational licensing of dentists did not lead to improved measured dental outcomes of patients \([p. 176](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217642001.pdf)(...the Rasmuson Founda-tion, and the Bethel Community Services Foundation showed that dental hygienists did as well as dentists in performing routine tasks such as the ones listed here \(Wetterhall et al. 2010\).)\).

The foster care system throughout the USA is already overcrowded \([nearly half a million children](http://www.childrensrights.org/newsroom/fact-sheets/foster-care/)\)and many children \(20,000 in 2015 alone\) remaining "in the system" until they "age out" at 18.	Community parenting licenses would allow communities to gather and license the resources necessary for supporting parents and children.	The act of parenting itself can change a person for the better. A parenting license would take that chance away from a person because of their present condition without taking into account that parenting could inspire them to do better.	A license is only able to screen people beforehand, not act as an intervention agent after a person has a license. Rather than preventing abuse, it simply prevents able prospective parents from procreating.	Under the status quo, abuse or neglect of infants or very young children often goes undetected.	If a child is to be removed from their family, it is best to do that when they are an infant.

Since it is impossible to prohibit someone to have a child, in the case of parent license, the state would need to get the child and take care of her. So, the taxpayers would pay for this.

parenting licenses violate parents' rights.	0_1.1.	Parenting licenses violate parents' rights.	con	A right can't inflict harm. A right to be an irresponsible parent inflicts harms on children. It is therefore the duty of the government to minimise the number of irresponsible parents.	Parenting licenses assess parents' competency prospectively. This violates the right to the [presumption of innocence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/presumption_of_innocence).	Humans have a right to procreate and to raise a child. If prospective parents are rejected a license, this policy infringes on their rights by preventing them from procreating.	Such a check will be an undue intrusion in the lives of every couple and might also result in snatching from them even little pleasures of life which the state labels as "adverse to the child." During the licensing process, questions asked might also violate the basic privacy that every family is entitled to. For example, simple things like upbringing of the parents might be brought into question.	One does not have the right to be a parent. If we did have this right, then it would be acceptable to assign parent-less children to childless couples on demand. The fact that adoption is a strenuous process demonstrates that parenting is not a right.	It would put the rights of the society above the rights of individual and abolish privacy at the most intimate level. Yet, society is a collection of more elementary units like individuals and families. Families are not a product of society, but vice versa. This has been seen in cases where societies have fallen, but families remained and ultimately formed the base for a new society. On the other hand, societies that have repressed families have run into trouble \(Revolution France, Soviet Union\)	As a society we decide what people's rights are. For example, society no longer believes that people have the right to own slaves.	This policy forces heterosexual couples to use birth control or practice abstinence by default. It therefore violates these individuals’ rights to privacy and bodily autonomy.	This would be against nature. Every animal has an instinct to reproduce. This instinct is not limited in natural conditions by any means, in fact to detrimental effects sometimes \(e.g. male mantis\). Humans are animals too. So it is impossible to kill natural instincts in them.	If such license were a legal reality, no rights would be in violation then as they would be redefined to fit the new legality of parenting licenses. Driver's licenses today do not violate my rights as a driver despite the fact I believe speed limits shouldn't apply to me.	The state should not interfere in the most personal decisions that an individual makes in the course of their lives.	Rights are not absolute and in some cases end up competing against each other.

When the state claims to provide for its citizens' rights, this entails providing their right to property, autonomy and education. This is executed by limiting a parent's right to bear children if they were to be an obstacle in the state's efforts to provide those rights to the potential child.	Procreation is a responsibility, not a right.	Some people are legally prohibited from raising a child.	Procreation requires a number of random variables, including biological capability, luck, and finding a consenting partner. None of these are rights.	Family is the [basic institution of society](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/rights/), and not having the right to start one means not having the right to be included in society in the same conditions as others. As people have a right to be a part of society, they have a right to start a family.	Under some of the world's largest religions, procreation is seen as a God-given right and, for some, a duty.

It is impossible to design a test that accurately assesses the ability to be a parent.	con	Children are unique, and the skills necessary to care for a particular, individual child are not predictable or easily teachable. It is impossible to know in advance what kind of person will be born, so it is impossible to know what skills should be tested in the first place.	Parenting licenses might not be perfect, but they would be better than having no license at all. Just in the same way as driving licenses are not perfect, but having a driving license system in place is still better than not having driving licenses at all.	There is no objective metric that determines an individual's parenting capabilities.	A one time assessment could not guarantee that the predetermined conditions for parenthood would be fulfilled throughout the course of a child's life.	Becoming a parent and receiving the responsibilities that come with it may fundamentally change a person. It is therefore difficult to accurately and fairly assess whether or not someone will be a good parent.	Inconsistencies and inefficiencies are inherent in any test. This will lead to deserving parents not being able to procreate and vice versa.	[Psychological research indicates](https://www.inc.com/anna-hensel/more-evidence-that-theres-no-magic-formula-for-raising-successful-kids.html) that there's no formula for raising successful vs. unsuccessful children.

Such a licensing system would eliminate the vast majority of people who wish to procreate, and would thus be unfair.	What constitutes ideal or adequate parenthood is at least partly a cultural value judgement that isn't meant to reflect a scientific standard \(but rather a cultural one\).	It is not impossible, it is just very difficult. Such a test would have to be itself tested and approved before being implemented.	The subjective nature of parenting methods would make this test rely solely on the subjective views of the person making the test, meaning that certain parenting styles would be denied for having children, and effectively be eliminated from the social gene pool.	There are better parenting technique than others. [Proper stimulation of children during critical periods of brain development](http://www.dana.org/News/Early_Life_Experience,_Critical_Periods,_and_Brain_Development/), for example, is not a matter of subjectivity.

Adopting a child requires a certain set of [conditions](https://adoptionnetwork.com/requirements-to-adopt-a-child) to be met.

In contrast, learning how to provide care to a child who was ill can be learnt through experience.	The fact that a significant number of parents abuse or neglect their children illustrate that this is not necessarily the case. Parenting is not something everyone can acquire through a child's life.	Even parents who care about their children can be bad parents, either by not knowing what raising a child involves, or simply by making bad decisions.	Such a trial and error process during a child's life can be harmful if parents consistently make wrong decisions. A license system will at the very least teach the basics of raising a child, guaranteeing a minimum standard of parenting.

Licensing would discriminate against people from poorer economic backgrounds, rather than support them.	This policy would affect women significantly more so than men.

Both the licensing body as an organisation and its individual members are likely to exhibit biases that will affect who receives a license.	Licensing would discriminate against those without political power.	Such practice would inevitably lead to disproportionate gender demographics and higher orphan rates as observed with China's one child policy. Many cultures and religions favor having boys, leaving female infants to be aborted, given up for adoption in the foster care system or simply abandoned. Such restrictive policies would recreate and exacerbate those socially engineered issues.	We could give accesible government licenses for 'parenting teachers' instead, with different degrees and directed to people with proven parenting skills and knowledge; such people would be allowed to assess, assist, intervene and report the type of parenting other people from any social group are providing.	In particular, this could be targeted against families of ethnic minorities.	All policies adversely affect one group over another. Otherwise there would be no point to having the policy at all.	Licensing could discriminate against single parents.	Licensing could discriminate against couples who procreate out of wedlock.	Licensing could discriminate against the disabled.	Stringent requirements that would become culturally invasive or discriminatory would be open to widespread criticism and backlash, much like discriminatory laws have faced in the past.

Even if there is no guarantee that everyone acquiring a parenting license will be a better parent than if they hadn't, there's a strong likelihood that most will gain some parenting knowledge and skills in the process of trying to get the license.	The existence of a license which sets broad standards of what makes a good parent might make parents complacent and content with only seeking to meet the minimum requirements of being an adequate parent according to the test.	Much like driver's licences, a parenting license sets a minimum standard. Even if some people are equally good, or better parents without one, it is likely to raise the lower end of acceptable parenting practices.	A one time assessment could not guarantee that the predetermined conditions for parenthood would be fulfilled throughout the course of a child's life.

The existence of a license which sets broad standards of what makes a good parent might make parents complacent and content with only seeking to meet the minimum requirements of being an adequate parent according to the test.	con	Without external parenting standards, parents are driven by metrics such as their child's happiness, success, piety etc., which provides an incentive to keep providing the child with what they deem is best for them.	If parents ensure that they fulfil the test's minimum requirements, they're less likely to take responsibility if their child fails at life or is unhappy.	This policy will set a minimum standard of parenting. Given the number of parents who often fail to meet even those, all parents settling for the standard imposed by licenses will still be an improvement.	As long as parents love their children, they will want to improve as parents.	The desire to acquire the license will mean that prospective parents themselves will try to learn more about how to become better parents. The license system will therefore encourage self-improvement in those who wish to procreate.	[All adoption agencies](https://www.adoptex.org/the-adoption-journey/adoption-basics/the-adoption-process/) [conduct interviews](http://www.parents.com/parenting/adoption/facts/4-steps-of-adoption/) and [home-studies](http://www.adopt.org/faqs), which are partly meant to be educative experiences for prospective parents. When such interviews are conducted in the licensing process, parents will have an opportunity to learn more about parenting.	Lawyers and doctors, who also require a license, continue to work and improve their skills, because they realise that the license provides them with the minimum set of qualifications necessary. Parents, similarly, will realise this and continue to improve.	As everyone who wants to be a parent has to meet the standards of being a good parent as determined by the state, these standards would become established as normative standards as well.

Without external parenting standards, parents are driven by metrics such as their child's happiness, success, piety etc., which provides an incentive to keep providing the child with what they deem is best for them.	con	Children may fail at life or end up unhappy because of other factors than how their parents raised them. This can make parents who do everything they can to raise their kids right, feel miserable and inadequate if their children are unhappy.	Parents who go to the effort of undertaking a license are likely to be driven by something other than merely passing the test; parents are likely to want happiness and success for their children in and of itself, rather than to fulfil a metric of their parenting skills.	Having external standards for parenting does not preclude having personal standards and aims for parenting. Implementing a license will not take these away.	Parents' own standards of 'success' may impinge on the child's wellbeing, and as such could be an example of bad parenting that the license is trying to get rid of.	It is easier for parents to follow clear standards that are set by an entity they deem legitimate, than it is to come up with their own answers for what makes a good parent. As many different views exists, finding an adequate answer may appear difficult.
while that's anecdotally true, the idea here is that, on average, children of parents with parent training will exhibit the positive health outcomes. in fact, a large part of parenting is teaching children to successfully cope with failure, experimentation, and development through overcoming challenges.	0_1.6.10.3.1.1.2.

If parents ensure that they fulfil the test's minimum requirements, they're less likely to take responsibility if their child fails at life or is unhappy.	con	Any parent who loves their child will try their hardest to ensure that their child lives a happy and fulfilling life; it is unlikely that they will become complacent when they see their child suffering.	Passing the test allows prospective parents to procreate, but does not guarantee that the child will live a happy life. It is unclear why parents will think obtaining a license ensures a happy life for the child.	Parents often have children when they think they are ready for them, yet still work hard when the child is born. Having the state simply confirm the already held belief of prospective parents that they are ready to have a child will not change this.

Where parents fail to provide basic conditions for their children, this is often at least in part due to a failure on the part of the state.
