AM: It's the analysis I want to come to next. This kind of blanket
entitlement to a judicial approach to things

that happened in the past is usually reserved for criminal regimes, like

ES:<span class="highlighted" id="node25"> Well actually, speak to those who are survivors</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node27">They did see this
as being like under the Third Reich in
