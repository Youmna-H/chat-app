MP: I understand your point <span class="highlighted" id="node7">and of course there are living victims</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node9">and
no one would deny that they were

treated in an appalling way</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node5">but you have just muddled up civil and
criminal cases</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node11"> I mean, there's no

statute of limitations for murder</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node116">and one can certainly say - this is
my point, if there are specific

perpetrators, if you have a tyrant, if you have a group of military
officers who are accused of committing a

war crime, then for sure, there should be no statute of limitations in
prosecuting them.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node17">You have a specific

perpetrator</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node19">But here you don't have specific perpetrators.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node21">What's
happening in this case is not the

prosecution of a crime</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node301"> it is a claim for compensation against the present
government, which had no

responsibility for what happened</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node25">Isn't that a source of injustice?</span>

ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node253">Definitely not</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node29">They do bear responsibility.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node31">Because those
liabilities actually transferred back to the

British Government</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node33">certainly that would not be the British Government's
view</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node222">but that would be the view of the claimants and their representatives.
And also the current government of Kenya.</span>
