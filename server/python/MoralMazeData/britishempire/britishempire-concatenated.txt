LA:
It
was a ghastly aberration.



CL:
Or
was it in fact typical?

Was it the product of a policy that was
unsustainable that could only be pursued by

increasing repression?

MB: Melanie Phillips?

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">You say in this case there are specific victims</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node3"> Isn't the problem
though that there are not very specific

perpetrators?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node5">Why should the present government of Britain be held
responsible for responsibility for the

these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago?</span>

ES: I disagree that there were not specific perpetrators. <span class="highlighted" id="node37">Obviously we
cannot for legal reasons go into sort

of identifying individuals</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node41">why the current government of today should
be held liable</span><span class="highlighted" id="node43"> is because there is an

outstanding crime that has been committed</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node45">these were not only, you
know, crimes of torture</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node47">there were

war crimes committed,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node49">there were crimes against humanity</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node51">My
understanding of international law is that

there is no statute of limitations</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node53">I think it would be totally
different if the survivors had all died</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node55">But actually, you have living victims.</span>LA: Well, leaving aside their legal case, which is a legal matter, let's
turn to colonialism, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I don't know what -

could you tell me what you think colonialism is</span>?

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node7">Well, I guess for my definition, I would talk about rich countries
in the West occupying countries of other people and imposing their rule on them
and generally speaking extracting various forms of wealth from

those countries to benefit the host country</span>.Enter your text here...AM: It's the analysis I want to come to next. This kind of blanket
entitlement to a judicial approach to things

that happened in the past is usually reserved for criminal regimes, like
the Third Reich. <span class="highlighted" id="node9">Is it not the case

that you are stretching your definition in order to make the British
Empire fit into that?</span>

ES:<span class="highlighted" id="node25"> Well actually, speak to those who are survivors</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node27">They did see this
as being like under the Third Reich in

effect.</span>

AM: You think that as well?

ES: Yes, I certainly do.
















<span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node1">Lee Jasper, is it your position that the
current British Government has a lot more to apologise for in

terms of colonialism than the
ill-treatment of some now elderly Kenyans?</span>

JA: It is indeed. <span class="highlighted" id="node19">It goes to the route of
the modern malaise of a non-inclusive notion of British citizenship.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node37">I

think the relics of colonialism, racism
and the current dystopia around in relation to people groping focus a

kind of inclusive British citizenship that
relieves them of the guilt of their - of the past, and opens up a vista

of an inclusive future, actually relies
on, to some extent, Britain having a truth and reconciliation moment,</span>

<span class="highlighted" id="node52">and saying, regardless of what the
specificities of legalities are, and they can produce some pretty perverse

judgments</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node64"> as we all know, the moral case
is absolutely unanswerable</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node73">and we ought to do the right thing</span>


















MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">But is it your view that the history
of colonialism, maybe the history of slavery, is responsible for racism

in Britain?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node7">Is that part of your case?</span>

JA: <span class="highlighted" id="node17">Well undoubtedly the contemporary
notion of racism, in terms of global white superiority, exemplified by

colonialism, and still has relics today in
our language, in our customs and practice, and as we've seen very

recently with John Terry in our courts,
still very much a sort of live issue</span>

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node32">Then how do you deal with the fact
that black countries, black people are racist</span>, slavery was a -

JA: <span class="highlighted" id="node44">I don't agree black people can be
racist in the United Kingdom context. </span><span class="highlighted" id="node53">They can be racially offensive</span>

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node68">They can't be prejudiced against white
people?</span>

JA: If you let me finish, I'll explain
what I'm saying to you. I believe that black people in the United Kingdom,

<span class="highlighted" id="node83">in order to effect racism, you really
need, in the proper sense of the word, you need prejudice and power</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node101">

And it's not something that is within the
scope of very many black British citizens, here in the United

Kingdom or Europe</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node109">If you're talking about
internationally, then racism is not just a dictionary definition</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node117"> but

it is imbued with geography, history and
culture</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node132">and that gives it its specific meaning</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node147">There is no universal

definition in relation to its application


















MB: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">From your point of view, even if this
hearing itself or the damages claims by these three individuals are

concerned, should it be the occasion for
examining the colonial legacy?</span>

ES: Most definitely. <span class="highlighted" id="node20">In fact, some of us
would argue the case doesn't go far enough</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node35">because the colonial

context is absent</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node51">and without recognising
colonialism, it's very hard to understand what actually took place.</span>


















AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node114">So the guilt must be on the side of
the colonial power</span>.

ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node119">We have to go to the roots of this
problem</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node130">We don't look at it halfway through</span>.

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node19">So it's a symbolic case, to open a
wider door?
</span>
ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node21">For some people it is.</span>

AM: For you?

ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node157">For me it is actually very
significant</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node164">it means that we are forced to engage in this

conversation</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node175">we are forced to do the
analysis</span>.

CL: Can we for a moment sit in judgment on British society at the end of
the 1950s <span class="highlighted" id="node129">when news first came of

the horrific massacre of Mau Mau prisoners in Kenya. Wide swathes of
British public opinion and the media

and the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were horrified and
disgusted then, 
















CL: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">This is all morally blameworthy?</span>

LA: <span class="highlighted" id="node7">Not to be in a funk when you are
reading intelligence reports which suggest your Empire is under

sustained assault</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node19">We know it wasn't</span>.

CL: <span class="highlighted" id="node125">This being the mess, a major injustice
was committed</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node132">a legal remedy exists</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node40">what's wrong with doing

the British thing, owning up and paying
up?</span>

LA: <span class="highlighted" id="node149">It's not a question of the British
thing</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node58">it's the British thing of legally examining it, and rationally going

through the evidence and finding complete
proof, total proof that these people suffered injuries in such a

place in such a way, and that the officers
who commanded them, then the judges and the lawyers can say

how far are these agents of the British
state</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node73">did the British state know what they were doing</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node167">I think it did.


















MB: Melanie Phillips, <span class="highlighted" id="node13">the first and third
witnesses didn't seem to draw much 6 a distinction between the

British Empire and the Third Reich.</span>

MP: No, <span class="highlighted" id="node32">and that was clearly absurd and
offensive insofar as they made that connection</span>, but I think to be

fair to them, <span class="highlighted" id="node163">what they were saying was
that atrocities should be - that war crimes or atrocities perpetrated

against civilians should be - that justice
should be done regardless of limit of time</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node60">but again, the point made

by Lawrence James was correct</span>, that, you
know, <span class="highlighted" id="node69">it was very regrettable in the case of Kenya that the

perpetrators of the Hola massacre and
other atrocities were not prosecuted at the time</span> but the problem is

that now, and this was a point I was
trying to get to with Esther Xosei, <span class="highlighted" id="node92">we don't have the perpetrators in

court</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node101">we are not prosecuting crimes that
were committed against these unfortunate people</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node107">they are

seeking civilian reparation</span>, and the
question is, why should they seek civilian - why should they seek

reparation against a government which had
nothing to do with it, <span class="highlighted" id="node139">and if you agree that people should be

able to seek civilian reparation decades
on, then there's no end to it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node154">There are all kinds of people who

have been dispossessed throughout history.</span><br>


















MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Of course you have to draw lines,
Melanie,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node7">but these people are alive</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node86">and I would say there is both a

pragmatic and a historic justification</span>.
<span class="highlighted" id="node25">The pragmatic justification is that they - if they are to take their case

against anybody, we, this state, the
British state now, is the closest they can get to it.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node31">They can't go back

and dig up Macmillan</span>.

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node50">That's not good enough</span>.

MT: <span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node65">Second, there's no question this
country has benefitted and continues to benefit from the extraction it

took from the British Empire.</span>

MB:
Thank you. Our last witness, is Dr Lloyd, Senior Lecturer, Defence
Studies Department at King's
College
at the Joint Services Command Staff College, Defence Academy of the
UK. <span class="highlighted" id="node3">Where does moral
justice
lie when we look back at our imperial past, would you say?</span>
NL:
<span class="highlighted" id="node5">Well, I think it very much depends which side you take it,</span> whether
<span class="highlighted" id="node50">you are on the side of the nationalist
movements
which replaced the British Empire</span> or <span class="highlighted" id="node59">are you on the side of the
imperialists which have had a
very
bad press for so many years?</span>MB:
<span class="highlighted" id="node111">What do you think?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3">Do you think we have got a lot to apologise for?</span>
NL:<span class="highlighted" id="node32">
I don't think we do</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">It very much depends on the specific incident
you are talking about and which side
are
you going to go on?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node9">We are talking about the violence which may have
been perpetrated against Mau
Mau
suspects</span> -
MB:
<span class="highlighted" id="node59">Well, the government has acknowledged that they were ill treated in
court, but I won't go on with that</span>.
NL:
<span class="highlighted" id="node80">We know Kenya was a brutal war,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node82">but what about the violence that the
Mau Mau perpetrated against
settlers
and particularly loyal Africans.</span>CL:
<span class="highlighted" id="node1">The horror that was going round there, which nearly cost Macmillan
his election, was horror at the way
the
British Army had behaved, not at Mau Mau.</span>
NL:
<span class="highlighted" id="node3">I think there was horror at Mau Mau.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node5"> Let's be straight, the situation
in Kenya was a bloody dirty war</span>,
and
no one really comes out very well but<span class="highlighted" id="node163"> it's a situation where, you
know, six years before the start of the
Kenya
emergency, the British Army in India is being hammered <span class="highlighted" id="node170">because it's
not brutal enough</span>, by the
nationalists
and the Muslims</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node181">they say you are not shooting people or controlling
the population, you are
basically
letting us die</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node58">So if you have an army it has a responsibility to
protect its citizens and protect other
African
communities</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node194">so in a sense we're saying that, you know, we're
criticising the fireman</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node202">because he has
used
too much water to actually, you know, quench the fire</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node213">I think these
judgments are very difficult to
make</span>.
CL:
I agree with you but<span class="highlighted" id="node106"> in the context of what we're talking about
tonight the strange phenomenon then
occurred,
where the British went in denial and have been in denial ever since.</span>
Is that not true?CL:
















MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node140">You say that Britain is non-inclusive</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node13">but I mean, relative to many other countries surely it's an

exemplar of inclusivity</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node28">for example, in
contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation

between black and white here in the way
that you do there.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node43">So in what sense is - you know, is Britain's

history responsible for a lack of
inclusiveness?</span>

JA: I think the British are very much - <span class="highlighted" id="node59">I
think you raise an interesting point</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node68">because whilst the African

Americans are socially segregated from
their American cousins, they are economically integrated</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node92">And the

extent to which an African American is
prepared to stand by the flag is far in advance than any black British

individual</span>. And I think - well, let me
finish. <span class="highlighted" id="node101">I think that hints to the kind of schism around citizenship that we

have here in the United Kingdom</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node116">It's not
a case of just legality</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node122">It is a case of people feeling that they have

a place</span>.


















AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node137">You said two things</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node143">You said it's
quite specific and you think of it as one specific legal trial with

evidence that can be weighed and damages
which may then be awarded</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node162">but you've also said that it's more

broadly about colonialism</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node40">Surely that
requires a very different approach</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node55">So what would justice look like to

you?</span>

ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node64">Justice to me would be multi-facetted</span>.
<span class="highlighted" id="node73">Of course, there is value in specific cases</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node79">we have to

acknowledge that there are survivors, who
have never experienced any form of recompense</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node94">you know,

these are elderly victims</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node100">they do need to
be compensated for the crimes that were committed against

them</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node117"> However, we must not lose sight of
the fact that they represent a class of people</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node132">and there are many

other survivors who do not currently have
access to justice</span>. So -


















AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">This took place in the colonial era</span>.
<span class="highlighted" id="node7">We also know that there were atrocities on both sides, including in

this big group of people that you've just
referred to</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node22">so would you be also happy for them to face trial for

atrocities committed against white
settlers and British service personnel at the time?</span>

ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node28">How I would answer that is I would
look at the context</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node40">This was a war of liberation</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node55"> Actually it was an

unjust war that was being levelled against
the Africans</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node67">They were dispossessed of their land, which began

formally, in terms of the carving up of
Africa</span>, so unless we look at this border context â€“

<span class="highlighted"><br></span><br>MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">You say you want to set the record state</span>, and that - <span class="highlighted" id="node10">straight and context is very important</span> but can I come back to this point Anne was asking about? It does strike me that <span class="highlighted" id="node25">you are in fact saying that the context is colonialism</span> but <span class="highlighted" id="node40">one could equally say the context for the atrocities having been carried out by agents of the British Government at the time, the context was the atrocities being carried out against them by the Mau Mau</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node51">Why are you being so selective about your context?</span>MB: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">What do you think is going on here?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3">If there is an element, if you
like, of retrospective moral judgments, are there problems with that?</span>

LA: <span class="highlighted" id="node22">I always have a problem of judging the past by our values</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node24">It seems
to me a mixture of arrogance and

absurdity</span>.

MB: Okay, Matthew Taylor?

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node52">I don't see really what the problem is here.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node58">There are three people
who it seems very likely suffered</span>,

<span class="highlighted" id="node60">they suffered in the context of imprisonment possibly</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node62">the way they
suffered was a crime</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node64">in almost any

jurisdiction in the world it would be seen as a crime</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node66">they have the
opportunity now to try to seek justice</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node68">the

closest they can get to the people who actually committed this is the
British state</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node70">and they're pursuing their

case</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node72">What's wrong with this?</span>Enter your text here...
















MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node181">Well, in terms of the case of these
individuals, do you accept that they have a perfect right to pursue

the claim that they are making and it is
reasonable for the British state, even though today's politicians

weren't implicated in this, for the
British state to be answerable of the actions of the British state in the past,

in this specific case, we will turn in a
moment to the wider question of Empire, but in this specific case</span>.

LA: <span class="highlighted" id="node47">The judiciary have ruled they have the
right to make this case</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node62">and they are proceeding with it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node197">There is

another legal principle which you have touched
on of how much, do we have a legal responsibility for the

actions of the past</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node208"> I mean, does Mr
Cameron have to answer for the decisions of, say, Lord Palmerston?</span>

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node219">Isn't it reasonable to argue that
given what they went through, as the closest they can get to the people

who perpetrated this is the British state,
indeed the state benefitted from colonialism in a variety of ways,

that it's reasonable that they should seek
recompense from the British state?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node125">Otherwise they have nowhere

to go</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node237">Otherwise we're simply saying,
well, the people who did this to you have gone</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node155">the injustice is

somehow over.</span>


















AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node249">So in that sense, any African at that
time cannot commit a crime against - if it's committed in </span>-

ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node7">I'm not saying that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node22">But we cannot
take away the fact that these were people who were simply fighting

to reclaim their lost lands</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node28">and it was a
freedom struggle</span>. And there is the -

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node46">Where does that take you? </span><span class="highlighted" id="node279">In terms of
moral responsibility then it, is pretty much anything allowed to

them because it was a struggle of
liberation as you describe it?</span>

ES: Yes, <span class="highlighted" id="node111">it was a struggle of liberation
</span>and <span class="highlighted" id="node113">I would refute the notion that these were terrorists</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node315">I think that

was a label that was given to them</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node327">and it
was a label that was very loaded</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node334">and of course when you classify

people as terrorists then you are seeking
to dehumanise them</span>

MP: I understand your point <span class="highlighted" id="node7">and of course there are living victims</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node9">and
no one would deny that they were

treated in an appalling way</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node5">but you have just muddled up civil and
criminal cases</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node11"> I mean, there's no

statute of limitations for murder</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node116">and one can certainly say - this is
my point, if there are specific

perpetrators, if you have a tyrant, if you have a group of military
officers who are accused of committing a

war crime, then for sure, there should be no statute of limitations in
prosecuting them.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node17">You have a specific

perpetrator</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node19">But here you don't have specific perpetrators.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node21">What's
happening in this case is not the

prosecution of a crime</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node301"> it is a claim for compensation against the present
government, which had no

responsibility for what happened</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node25">Isn't that a source of injustice?</span>

ES: <span class="highlighted" id="node253">Definitely not</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node29">They do bear responsibility.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node31">Because those
liabilities actually transferred back to the

British Government</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node33">certainly that would not be the British Government's
view</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node222">but that would be the view of the claimants and their representatives.
And also the current government of Kenya.</span>
















MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node141">So prejudice and power is a Marxist
concept</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">What you are saying is people who are powerless cannot

be prejudiced</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node17">So when black people say,
for example, Jews control the banks, that's not prejudice?</span>

JA: <span class="highlighted" id="node35">That's racially offensive</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node51">but it's
not racism</span>

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node69">It's not racism?</span> I see.

racially offensive without being a racist</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node102">Margaret Thatcher's

MB: <span class="highlighted" id="node51">How much sympathy generally around the
table was there for Lee Jasper's view that some form of

Mdeba moment, as he put it, reconciliation
or acknowledgment of the sins of the past is something that we

desperately require to bring about an
inclusive multi-racial community?</span>

CL: Can I put it this way? <span class="highlighted" id="node63">I personally as
an English person feel ashamed about the way the British

behaved in these circumstances in Africa
at that time.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node69">And I would feel better if the people who had suffered

that injustice were compensated</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node102">and if
it's an emotional thing to do with blame and guilt, if you like, me I

personally feel dishonoured by what was done in
my name</span>.




















MT: Anne, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">don't you think we are quite
hung up about this </span>and don't you think there's quite a lot -

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node7">I don't think I am in the same way</span>.

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node22">Don't you think there's a streak that
says, it was a pretty balanced account, there's nothing wrong with

colonialism.</span>

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node28">I don't think people do think that</span>.

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node46">That's a caricature</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node61">For decades, our
children have been taught nothing other than the Empire was

uniquely dreadful</span>.

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node76">I didn't learn that in school, 40
years ago</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node91">I was told it was generally speaking a good thing</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node106">Maybe

there should be a window of apology and
getting back to common sense.</span>

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node121">Under the national curriculum, we were
told the Empire was bad.</span>

MT: Neil Ferguson is saying <span class="highlighted" id="node157">it is great
today</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node176">so the moment has passed</span>.


















MB: Anne McElvoy, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">there is a rather
interesting tension between this idea of trying to make moral

judgments about the past through the prism
of the present, if you like,</span> when you're talk - the last witness

talked about, well, <span class="highlighted" id="node7">the 17th century was a
completely different universe</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node26"> which I think was quite a powerful

point</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node198">and yet Clifford also had a
powerful point in cross-examination </span>when <span class="highlighted" id="node203">he was saying, actually, in this

particular case, what are crimes now were
very much crimes then</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node53">It wasn't that distant in moral terms from

where we are now</span>.

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node68">That is interesting</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node228">that is a good
case and something I do take very seriously</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node100">and we do look back to

the fact that people were making stirring
speeches about it at the time</span> but <span class="highlighted" id="node245">that plays against Matthew's

point</span>, that <span class="highlighted" id="node252">colonialism, as we keep
calling it, is in some way all about the extraction of wealth and

exploitation</span>.

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node125">That's what drove it</span>.

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node140">But that's your opinion</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node155">and that is a
very, very partial view of history.</span>

MT: Lee Jasper had a good point in that
regard.


















MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">So this is revenge for the benefit?</span>

MB: <span class="highlighted" id="node7">So it would be okay under these
circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages

case against Angela Merkel, would it?</span>

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node13">This is a very interesting point.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node31">You
do get reparations in Germany</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node46">but also the recognition in Germany

of their responsibility for the Holocaust
is much, much more unambiguous</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node304">I think what was interesting

tonight is when you hear Lawrence James
who I think was the second witness</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node54">he doesn't really like this

case</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node60">because he wants to muddy the
waters</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node75">He wants to say, well, there was good and bad</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node98">and I think

that's a hang up Britain has got</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node113">When you
see these cases, there is still a strong feeling of saying, it wasn't

so bad after all</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node327">that's precisely the
point that Esther Stanford-Xosei was making. The reason we need

these case assist because of that
ambiguity</span>.

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node153">The difference is that this was an
aberration</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node346">I wouldn't go as far as Lawrence James went</span>, to say <span class="highlighted" id="node352">this

was an aberration</span> and the Empire - <span class="highlighted" id="node364">nothing
horrible was done under the Empire</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node193">I think a lot of bad things

were done under the Empire</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node208">but basically
bad things done under the Empire were an aberration</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node216">The

Empire brought a lot of good things</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node222">colonialism brought a lot of good things</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node240">that's the great difference

between the Empire and Nazism</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node257">Nothing
good happened under Nazism</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node272">It was in essence a tyranny </span>and

<span class="highlighted" id="node287">therefore the country was responsible for
what happened in a way that Britain is not responsible,

collectively, in the same way, for what
happened to these people.</span>


















MT:<span class="highlighted" id="node116"> Let's not forget, there has been a
revisionist itself to say, let's rebalance this, actually the Empire wasn't

so bad</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node7">so this is a live debate</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node23">and I
think that goes to the point that actually this is why these cases are

significant</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node38"> and they should be tried</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node53">because they take us to questions we have still got to resolve.</span>

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node77">Was anyone remotely convinced by Lee
Jasper's argument that this would help black Britons today?</span>

<span class="highlighted" id="node86">There are problems in the education
system, problems of underperformance, problems in the employment

market</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node98">and the idea that having some sort
of moment which would really be about disinterring the past is

going to be remotely helpful is, I think, beyond
credibility.</span>
