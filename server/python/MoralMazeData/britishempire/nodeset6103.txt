MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">So this is revenge for the benefit?</span>

MB: <span class="highlighted" id="node7">So it would be okay under these
circumstances for, say, a holocaust victim to take a civil damages

case against Angela Merkel, would it?</span>

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node13">This is a very interesting point.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node31">You
do get reparations in Germany</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node46">but also the recognition in Germany

of their responsibility for the Holocaust
is much, much more unambiguous</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node304">I think what was interesting

tonight is when you hear Lawrence James
who I think was the second witness</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node54">he doesn't really like this

case</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node60">because he wants to muddy the
waters</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node75">He wants to say, well, there was good and bad</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node98">and I think

that's a hang up Britain has got</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node113">When you
see these cases, there is still a strong feeling of saying, it wasn't

so bad after all</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node327">that's precisely the
point that Esther Stanford-Xosei was making. The reason we need

these case assist because of that
ambiguity</span>.

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node153">The difference is that this was an
aberration</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node346">I wouldn't go as far as Lawrence James went</span>, to say <span class="highlighted" id="node352">this

was an aberration</span> and the Empire - <span class="highlighted" id="node364">nothing
horrible was done under the Empire</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node193">I think a lot of bad things

were done under the Empire</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node208">but basically
bad things done under the Empire were an aberration</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node216">The

Empire brought a lot of good things</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node222">colonialism brought a lot of good things</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node240">that's the great difference

between the Empire and Nazism</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node257">Nothing
good happened under Nazism</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node272">It was in essence a tyranny </span>and

<span class="highlighted" id="node287">therefore the country was responsible for
what happened in a way that Britain is not responsible,

collectively, in the same way, for what
happened to these people.</span>
