MB: Melanie Phillips, <span class="highlighted" id="node13">the first and third
witnesses didn't seem to draw much 6 a distinction between the

British Empire and the Third Reich.</span>

MP: No, <span class="highlighted" id="node32">and that was clearly absurd and
offensive insofar as they made that connection</span>, but I think to be

fair to them, <span class="highlighted" id="node163">what they were saying was
that atrocities should be - that war crimes or atrocities perpetrated

against civilians should be - that justice
should be done regardless of limit of time</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node60">but again, the point made

by Lawrence James was correct</span>, that, you
know, <span class="highlighted" id="node69">it was very regrettable in the case of Kenya that the

perpetrators of the Hola massacre and
other atrocities were not prosecuted at the time</span> but the problem is

that now, and this was a point I was
trying to get to with Esther Xosei, <span class="highlighted" id="node92">we don't have the perpetrators in

court</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node101">we are not prosecuting crimes that
were committed against these unfortunate people</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node107">they are

seeking civilian reparation</span>, and the
question is, why should they seek civilian - why should they seek

reparation against a government which had
nothing to do with it, <span class="highlighted" id="node139">and if you agree that people should be

able to seek civilian reparation decades
on, then there's no end to it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node154">There are all kinds of people who

have been dispossessed throughout history.</span><br>
