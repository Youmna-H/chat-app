current British Government has a lot more to apologise for in

relieves them of the guilt of their - of the past, and opens up a vista

of an inclusive future, actually relies
on, to some extent, Britain having a truth and reconciliation moment,</span>

<span class="highlighted" id="node52">and saying, regardless of what the
specificities of legalities are, and they can produce some pretty perverse

judgments</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node64"> as we all know, the moral case
is absolutely unanswerable</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node73">and we ought to do the right thing</span>
