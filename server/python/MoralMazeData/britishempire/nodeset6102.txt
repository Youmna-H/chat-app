MB: Anne McElvoy, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">there is a rather
interesting tension between this idea of trying to make moral

judgments about the past through the prism
of the present, if you like,</span> when you're talk - the last witness

talked about, well, <span class="highlighted" id="node7">the 17th century was a
completely different universe</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node26"> which I think was quite a powerful

point</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node198">and yet Clifford also had a
powerful point in cross-examination </span>when <span class="highlighted" id="node203">he was saying, actually, in this

particular case, what are crimes now were
very much crimes then</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node53">It wasn't that distant in moral terms from

where we are now</span>.

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node68">That is interesting</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node228">that is a good
case and something I do take very seriously</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node100">and we do look back to

the fact that people were making stirring
speeches about it at the time</span> but <span class="highlighted" id="node245">that plays against Matthew's

point</span>, that <span class="highlighted" id="node252">colonialism, as we keep
calling it, is in some way all about the extraction of wealth and

exploitation</span>.

MT: <span class="highlighted" id="node125">That's what drove it</span>.

AM: <span class="highlighted" id="node140">But that's your opinion</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node155">and that is a
very, very partial view of history.</span>

MT: Lee Jasper had a good point in that
regard.
