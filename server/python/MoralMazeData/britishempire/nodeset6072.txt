MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node140">You say that Britain is non-inclusive</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node13">but I mean, relative to many other countries surely it's an

exemplar of inclusivity</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node28">for example, in
contrast to, say, America, you don't have a kind of polarisation

between black and white here in the way
that you do there.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node43">So in what sense is - you know, is Britain's

history responsible for a lack of
inclusiveness?</span>

JA: I think the British are very much - <span class="highlighted" id="node59">I
think you raise an interesting point</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node68">because whilst the African

Americans are socially segregated from
their American cousins, they are economically integrated</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node92">And the

extent to which an African American is
prepared to stand by the flag is far in advance than any black British

individual</span>. And I think - well, let me
finish. <span class="highlighted" id="node101">I think that hints to the kind of schism around citizenship that we

have here in the United Kingdom</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node116">It's not
a case of just legality</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node122">It is a case of people feeling that they have

a place</span>.
