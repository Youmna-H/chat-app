MB: Melanie Phillips?

MP: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">You say in this case there are specific victims</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node3"> Isn't the problem
though that there are not very specific

perpetrators?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node5">Why should the present government of Britain be held
responsible for responsibility for the

these atrocities of its predecessor administration many decades ago?</span>

ES: I disagree that there were not specific perpetrators. <span class="highlighted" id="node37">Obviously we
cannot for legal reasons go into sort

of identifying individuals</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node41">why the current government of today should
be held liable</span><span class="highlighted" id="node43"> is because there is an

outstanding crime that has been committed</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node45">these were not only, you
know, crimes of torture</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node47">there were

war crimes committed,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node49">there were crimes against humanity</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node51">My
understanding of international law is that

there is no statute of limitations</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node53">I think it would be totally
different if the survivors had all died</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node55">But actually, you have living victims.</span>
