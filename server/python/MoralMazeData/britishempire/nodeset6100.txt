AM: But to come back to what Michael
asked, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">it is a very partial view</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node7">and it doesn't really answer why there

was such outrage about it</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node22">if it's such an
exploitative thing, why was there outrage?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node129">So it is a good point

Clifford makes</span> and also <span class="highlighted" id="node33">it speaks well for
the case that is being brought at the moment</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node39">it does not speak

so well for broadening it out into a
reckoning with everything else</span>.

MB: <span class="highlighted" id="node51">How much sympathy generally around the
table was there for Lee Jasper's view that some form of

Mdeba moment, as he put it, reconciliation
or acknowledgment of the sins of the past is something that we

desperately require to bring about an
inclusive multi-racial community?</span>

CL: Can I put it this way? <span class="highlighted" id="node63">I personally as
an English person feel ashamed about the way the British

behaved in these circumstances in Africa
at that time.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node69">And I would feel better if the people who had suffered

that injustice were compensated</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node102">and if
it's an emotional thing to do with blame and guilt, if you like, me I

personally feel dishonoured by what was done in
my name</span>.
