Thank you. Our last witness, is Dr Lloyd, Senior Lecturer, Defence
Studies Department at King's
College
at the Joint Services Command Staff College, Defence Academy of the
UK. <span class="highlighted" id="node3">Where does moral
justice
lie when we look back at our imperial past, would you say?</span>
NL:
<span class="highlighted" id="node5">Well, I think it very much depends which side you take it,</span> whether
<span class="highlighted" id="node50">you are on the side of the nationalist
movements
which replaced the British Empire</span> or <span class="highlighted" id="node59">are you on the side of the
imperialists which have had a
very
bad press for so many years?</span>
