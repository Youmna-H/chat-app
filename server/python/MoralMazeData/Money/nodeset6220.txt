<span class="highlighted" id="node1">I've got in front of me a letter from a
credit card company</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">There are two figures on this letter which really stand
out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers</span>. 

<span class="highlighted" id="node16">Now, underneath that, in small print,
it becomes absolutely clear that youâ€™ll be paying all sorts of charges</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node25">And
then very, very quickly youâ€™ll be lured into paying a very large charge</span>. 

<span class="highlighted" id="node40">Do you think itâ€™s responsible to
encourage people to mis-read something like that?</span>
