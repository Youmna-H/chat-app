<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Panel, thanks very
much indeed. Our first witness is Simon Rose, whoâ€™s a spokesman for a
campaigning organisation called Save our Savers.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3">Why
do savers need saving?</span>

Simon Rose:<span class="highlighted" id="node111">Well, itâ€™s interesting
that you should imply that saving is morally good and can lead you to not be
dependent</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node3">because actually sometimes taking out credit can also help you not
be dependent.</span> Is that not true?

<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Yes. So, in that sense
then, itâ€™s quite morally neutral. This is the point I'm making.</span> 

<span class="highlighted" id="node9">Because say for example, I donâ€™t
know, a young person decides to take out a mortgage, which is taking out a
massive debt, so that they donâ€™t have to be dependent on their parents, or
donâ€™t have to be maybe dependent on a council house. Itâ€™s a sign of
independence.</span>

nations not have any responsibility for what they borrow?</span>

Nick Dearden:	Yes,<span class="highlighted" id="node23"> very often
they do have responsibility for what they borrow</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node5"> But thatâ€™s within
a much wider social context, wherein those individual decisions are
mediated</span>I donâ€™t for a moment understand
what you mean.

<br>


Nick Dearden:	<span class="highlighted" id="node123">Well, for example,
look at the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. 

Now,
are you saying that the reason that so many people have defaulted on
their mortgages is a result of tens of thousands of random decisions
by individuals?</span><span class="highlighted" id="node62"> 

I
donâ€™t think it is.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node77">I think itâ€™s to do with credit liberalisation
in the United States.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node79"> And, in turn, the credit liberalisation was
fuelled as a specific economic policy to paper over the cracks of
inequality, as a result of other economic policies</span>.. So, for example, you look at the sub-prime-

being prudent anymore</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">They get nothing out of it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node22">Prudent/imprudent, it makes
no difference to people lending their money to banks</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node37">They face the same risk</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node54">because their risk is really with the government, and whether the government
will intervene</span>.

Nick Dearden:<span class="highlighted" id="node1">	I think in the
current situation that both savers and borrowers, if you're talking
about individual people, are doing extremely badly.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3">Because many
people are unable to make ends meet and are having to take debt out
at huge levels of interest.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node5">On the other hand, savers are earning
nothing in interest.</span> 

<span class="highlighted" id="node7">And
what this needs is not simply us putting moral blame on one side or
the other, but actually putting moral blame on a set of economic
policies and political decisions that have led to credit
liberalisation.
</span>
<br>


Michael Portillo:	But [<span class="highlighted" id="node45">why
are borrowers doing badly?</span> RC]
<span class="highlighted" id="node47">I mean on the one hand interest rates are being kept really low, in
order that borrowers wonâ€™t bear the consequences of their foolish
borrowing.</span> 

<span class="highlighted" id="node49">And
then again, not many people have been driven out of the houses on
which they canâ€™t afford to maintain their payments, </span><span class="highlighted" id="node94">because the
banks are so terrified that if they crystallise the debts their
balance sheets will be insupportable.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node110"> 

So,
actually, people have run up lots of debt, are paying very low rates
of interest, and theyâ€™re able to continue to live in houses that
they canâ€™t afford to pay for.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node62">

Michael Buerk:	John Lamiday,
thank you very much indeed for joining us this evening. 

Our
third witness is Nick Dearden, who is director of the Jubilee Debt
Campaign. 

<span class="highlighted" id="node96">Mr
Dearden, youâ€™d like people not to have to pay their debts</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node106">Whereâ€™s
the morality in that?</span>

<br>


Nick Dearden:<span class="highlighted" id="node40">	I wouldnâ€™t like
people not to have to pay their debts across the board.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node49"> 

But
I think what we say is that this isnâ€™t simply a matter of
individual morality</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node73">Debt is used time and again as a set of economic
decisions, and political decisions, to achieve certain things in
society</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node75"> 

And
very often what high levels of debt can mean, and especially when the
debt is on very unjust terms, is a massive redistribution of wealth
in society, from the poorest to the richest.</span>
















<span class="highlighted" id="node1">And if the best way of making
money is to encourage people to take out debts that they canâ€™t afford, the best
way to make money is to encourage people to take out mortgages they canâ€™t
afford, then that is what capitalism has reverted to</span>. 

<span class="highlighted" id="node7">And so we have a system
dominated not by productive capitalism but by finance capitalism and consumer
capitalism</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node23">And it seems to be odd that Jamie Whyte talks about culture so
much, and doesnâ€™t refer to the cultural norms that are created by the dominance
of those models.</span>

<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Michael Portillo, are you a saver
or a debtor?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3">And is there a moral distinction between the two? </span>

Michael Portillo:
















Matthew
Taylor:
















<span class="highlighted" id="node1">And in particular he was rather
flattering, wasnâ€™t he Michael Portillo, about the virtue of putting off making
buying decisions until you can actually afford it, which is a very
old-fashioned virtue</span>.
