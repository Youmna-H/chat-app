Michael Buerk:	John Lamiday,
thank you very much indeed for joining us this evening. 

Our
third witness is Nick Dearden, who is director of the Jubilee Debt
Campaign. 

<span class="highlighted" id="node96">Mr
Dearden, youâ€™d like people not to have to pay their debts</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node106">Whereâ€™s
the morality in that?</span>

<br>


Nick Dearden:<span class="highlighted" id="node40">	I wouldnâ€™t like
people not to have to pay their debts across the board.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node49"> 

But
I think what we say is that this isnâ€™t simply a matter of
individual morality</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node73">Debt is used time and again as a set of economic
decisions, and political decisions, to achieve certain things in
society</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node75"> 

And
very often what high levels of debt can mean, and especially when the
debt is on very unjust terms, is a massive redistribution of wealth
in society, from the poorest to the richest.</span>
