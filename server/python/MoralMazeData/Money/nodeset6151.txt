Nick Dearden:<span class="highlighted" id="node1">	I think in the
current situation that both savers and borrowers, if you're talking
about individual people, are doing extremely badly.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3">Because many
people are unable to make ends meet and are having to take debt out
at huge levels of interest.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node5">On the other hand, savers are earning
nothing in interest.</span> 

<span class="highlighted" id="node7">And
what this needs is not simply us putting moral blame on one side or
the other, but actually putting moral blame on a set of economic
policies and political decisions that have led to credit
liberalisation.

Michael Portillo:	But [<span class="highlighted" id="node45">why
are borrowers doing badly?</span> RC]
<span class="highlighted" id="node47">I mean on the one hand interest rates are being kept really low, in
order that borrowers wonâ€™t bear the consequences of their foolish
borrowing.</span> 

<span class="highlighted" id="node49">And
then again, not many people have been driven out of the houses on
which they canâ€™t afford to maintain their payments, </span><span class="highlighted" id="node94">because the
banks are so terrified that if they crystallise the debts their
balance sheets will be insupportable.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node110"> 

So,
actually, people have run up lots of debt, are paying very low rates
of interest, and theyâ€™re able to continue to live in houses that
they canâ€™t afford to pay for.</span>
